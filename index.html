              <h3>From H.A. TAINE'S "INTRODUCTION TO ENGLISH LITERATURE"</h3>
              <p>Through the pages of a book the reader sees the life of past days. Carnivals, processions, battles, coronations, voyages - the whole history of the world and its people is revealed in a stupendous pageant. Taine was a Frenchman who wrote an unsurpassed history of English literature; its introduction reveals the unusual combination of an imaginative and an analytical style.

              <h3>From HENRY FIELDING'S "PREFACE TO JOSEPH ANDREWS"</h3>
              <p>Fielding wrote a lengthy story to burlesque a novel of Richardson. But the travesty overshot its mark. Instead of a mere parody, it became a masterpiece.
