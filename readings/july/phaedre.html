      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene I</h2>

      <h3>HIPPOLYTUS, THERAMENES.</h3>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        MY mind is settled, dear Theramenes, <br>
        And I can stay no more in lovely Trœzen.<br>
        In doubt that racks my soul with mortal anguish,<br>
        I grow ashamed of such long idleness.<br>
        Six months and more my father has been gone,<br>
        And what may have befallen one so dear<br>
        I know not, nor what corner of the earth<br>
        Hides him.
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        And where, prince, will you look for him? <br>
Already, to content your just alarm, <br>
Have I not cross’d the seas on either side <br>
Of Corinth, ask’d if aught were known of Theseus <br>
Where Acheron is lost among the Shades, <br>
Visited Elis, doubled Tœnarus, <br>
And sail’d into the sea that saw the fall <br>
Of Icarus? Inspired with what new hope, <br>
Under what favour’d skies think you to trace <br>
His footsteps? Who knows if the King, your father, <br>
Wishes the secret of his absence known? <br>
Perchance, while we are trembling for his life, <br>
The hero calmly plots some fresh intrigue, <br>
And only waits till the deluded fair—
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        Cease, dear Theramenes, respect the name<br>
        Of Theseus. Youthful errors have been left<br>
        Behind, and no unworthy obstacle<br>
        Detains him. Phædra long has fix’d a heart<br>
        Inconstant once, nor need she fear a rival.<br>
        In seeking him I shall but do my duty,<br>
        And leave a place I dare no longer see.
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        Indeed! When, prince, did you begin to dread<br>
        These peaceful haunts, so dear to happy childhood,<br>
        Where I have seen you oft prefer to stay,<br>
        Rather than meet the tumult and the pomp<br>
        Of Athens and the court? What danger shun you,<br>
        Or shall I say what grief?
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        That happy time<br>
      Is gone, and all is changed, since to these shores<br>
      The gods sent Phædra.
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        I perceive the cause<br>
      Of your distress. It is the queen whose sight<br>
      Offends you. With a step dame’s spite she schemed<br>
      Your exile soon as she set eyes on you.<br>
      But if her hatred is not wholly vanish’d,<br>
      It has at least taken a milder aspect.<br>
      Besides, what danger can a dying woman,<br>
      One too who longs for death, bring on your dead?<br>
      Can Phædra, sick’ning of a dire disease<br>
      Of which she will not speak, weary of life<br>
      And of herself, form any plots against you?
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        It is not her vain enmity I fear,<br>
        Another foe alarms Hippolytus.<br>
        I fly, it must be own’d, from young Aricia,<br>
        The sole survivor of an impious race.
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        What! You become her persecutor too!<br>
        The gentle sister of the cruel sons<br>
        Of Pallas shared not in their perfidy;<br>
        Why should you hate such charming innocence?
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        I should not need to fly, if it were hatred.
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        May I, then, learn the meaning of your flight?<br>
        Is this the proud Hippolytus I see,<br>
        Than whom there breathed no fiercer foe to love<br>
        And to that yoke which Theseus has so oft<br>
        Endured? And can it be that Venus, scorn’d<br>
        So long, will justify your sire at last?<br>
        Has she, then, setting you with other mortals,<br>
        Forced e’en Hippolytus to offer incense<br>
        Before her? Can you love?
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        Friend, ask me not.<br>
      You, who have known my heart from infancy<br>
      And all its feelings of disdainful pride,<br>
      Spare me the shame of disavowing all<br>
      That I profess’d. Born of an Amazon,<br>
      The wildness that you wonder at I suck’d<br>
      With mother’s milk. When come to riper age,<br>
      Reason approved what Nature had implanted.<br>
      Sincerely bound to me by zealous service,<br>
      You told me then the story of my sire,<br>
      And know how oft, attentive to your voice,<br>
      I kindled when I heard his noble acts,<br>
      As you described him bringing consolation<br>
      To mortals for the absence of Alcides,<br>
      The highways clear’d of monsters and of robbers,<br>
      Procrustes, Cercyon, Sciro, Sinnis slain,<br>
      The Epidaurian giant’s bones dispersed,<br>
      Crete reeking with the blood of Minotaur.<br>
      But when you told me of less glorious deeds,<br>
      Troth plighted here and there and everywhere,<br>
      Young Helen stolen from her home at Sparta,<br>
      And Peribœa’s tears in Salamis,<br>
      With many another trusting heart deceived<br>
      Whose very names have ’scaped his memory,<br>
      Forsaken Ariadne to the rocks<br>
      Complaining, last this Phædra, bound to him<br>
      By better ties,—you know with what regret<br>
      I heard and urged you to cut short the tale,<br>
      Happy had I been able to erase<br>
      From my remembrance that unworthy part<br>
      Of such a splendid record. I, in turn,<br>
      Am I too made the slave of love, and brought<br>
      To stoop so low? The more contemptible<br>
      That no renown is mine such as exalts<br>
      The name of Theseus, that no monsters quell’d<br>
      Have given me a right to share his weakness.<br>
      And if my pride of heart must needs be humbled,<br>
      Aricia should have been the last to tame it.<br>
      Was I beside myself to have forgotten<br>
      Eternal barriers of separation<br>
      Between us? By my father’s stern command<br>
      Her brethren’s blood must ne’er be reinforced<br>
      By sons of hers; he dreads a single shoot<br>
      From stock so guilty, and would fain with her<br>
      Bury their name, that, even to the tomb<br>
      Content to be his ward, for her no torch<br>
      Of Hymen may be lit. Shall I espouse<br>
      Her rights against my sire, rashly provoke<br>
      His wrath, and launch upon a mad career—
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        The gods, dear prince, if once your hour is come,<br>
        Care little for the reasons that should guide us.<br>
        Wishing to shut your eyes, Theseus unseals them;<br>
        His hatred, stirring a rebellious flame<br>
        Within you, lends his enemy new charms.<br>
        And, after all, why should a guiltless passion<br>
        Alarm you? Dare you not essay its sweetness,<br>
        But follow rather a fastidious scruple?<br>
        Fear you to stray where Hercules has wander’d?<br>
        What heart so stout that Venus has not vanquish’d?<br>
        Where would you be yourself, so long her foe,<br>
        Had your own mother, constant in her scorn<br>
        Of love, ne’er glowed with tenderness for Theseus?<br>
        What boots it to affect a pride you feel not?<br>
        Confess it, all is changed; for some time past<br>
        You have been seldom seen with wild delight<br>
        Urging the rapid car along the strand,<br>
        Or, skilful in the art that Neptune taught,<br>
        Making th’ unbroken steed obey the bit;<br>
        Less often have the woods return’d our shouts;<br>
        A secret burden on your spirits cast<br>
        Has dimm’d your eye. How can I doubt you love?<br>
        Vainly would you conceal the fatal wound.<br>
        Has not the fair Aricia touch’d your heart?
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        Theramenes, I go to find my father.
      </p>

      <em>Theramenes</em>

      <p>
        Will you not see the queen before you start,<br>
        My prince?
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        That is my purpose: you can tell her.<br>
        Yes, I will see her; duty bids me do it.<br>
        But what new ill vexes her dear Œnone?
      </p>

      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene II</h2>

      <h3>HIPPOLYTUS,  ŒNONE,  THERAMENES</h3>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Alas, my lord, what grief was e’er like mine?<br>
        The queen has almost touch’d the gates of death.<br>
        Vainly close watch I keep by day and night,<br>
        E’en in my arms a secret malady<br>
        Slays her, and all her senses are disorder’d.<br>
        Weary yet restless from her couch she rises,<br>
        Pants for the outer air, but bids me see<br>
        That no one on her misery intrudes.<br>
        She comes.
      </p>

      <em>Hippolytus</em>

      <p>
        Enough. She shall not be disturb’d,<br>
      Nor be confronted with a face she hates.
      </p>

      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene III</h2>

      <h3>PHÆDRA,  ŒNONE</h3>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        We have gone far enough. Stay, dear Œnone;<br>
        Strength fails me, and I needs must rest awhile.<br>
        My eyes are dazzled with this glaring light<br>
        So long unseen, my trembling knees refuse<br>
        Support. Ah me!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Would Heaven that our tears<br>
      Might bring relief!
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Ah, how these cumbrous gauds,<br>
      These veils oppress me! What officious hand<br>
      Has tied these knots, and gather’d o’er my brow<br>
      These clustering coils? How all conspires to add<br>
      To my distress!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        What is one moment wish’d,<br>
      The next, is irksome. Did you not just now,<br>
      Sick of inaction, bid us deck you out,<br>
      And, with your former energy recall’d,<br>
      Desire to go abroad, and see the light<br>
      Of day once more? You see it, and would fain<br>
      Be hidden from the sunshine that you sought.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Thou glorious author of a hapless race,<br>
        Whose daughter ’twas my mother’s boast to be,<br>
        Who well may’st blush to see me in such plight,<br>
        For the last time I come to look on thee,<br>
        O Sun!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        What! Still are you in love with death?<br>
      Shall I ne’er see you, reconciled to life,<br>
      Forego these cruel accents of despair?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Would I were seated in the forest’s shade!<br>
        When may I follow with delighted eye,<br>
        Thro’ glorious dust flying in full career,<br>
        A chariot—
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Madam?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Have I lost my senses?<br>
      What said I? and where am I? Whither stray<br>
      Vain wishes? Ah! The gods have made me mad.<br>
      I blush, Œnone, and confusion covers<br>
      My face, for I have let you see too clearly<br>
      The shame of grief that, in my own despite,<br>
      O’erflows these eyes of mine.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        If you must blush,<br>
      Blush at a silence that inflames your woes.<br>
      Resisting all my care, deaf to my voice,<br>
      Will you have no compassion on yourself,<br>
      But let your life be ended in mid course?<br>
      What evil spell has drain’d its fountain dry?<br>
      Thrice have the shades of night obscured the heav’ns<br>
      Since sleep has enter’d thro’ your eyes, and thrice<br>
      The dawn has chased the darkness thence, since food<br>
      Pass’d your wan lips, and you are faint and languid.<br>
      To what dread purpose is your heart inclined?<br>
      How dare you make attempts upon your life,<br>
      And so offend the gods who gave it you,<br>
      Prove false to Theseus and your marriage vows,<br>
      Ay, and betray your most unhappy children,<br>
      Bending their necks yourself beneath the yoke?<br>
      That day, be sure, which robs them of their mother,<br>
      Will give high hopes back to the stranger’s son,<br>
      To that proud enemy of you and yours,<br>
      To whom an Amazon gave birth, I mean<br>
      Hippolytus—
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Ye gods!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Ah, this reproach<br>
      Moves you!
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Unhappy woman, to what name<br>
      Gave your mouth utterance?
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Your wrath is just.<br>
      ’Tis well that that ill-omen’d name can rouse<br>
      Such rage. Then live. Let love and duty urge<br>
      Their claims. Live, suffer not this son of Scythia,<br>
      Crushing your children ’neath his odious sway,<br>
      To rule the noble offspring of the gods,<br>
      The purest blood of Greece. Make no delay;<br>
      Each moment threatens death; quickly restore<br>
      Your shatter’d strength, while yet the torch of life<br>
      Holds out, and can be fann’d into a flame.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Too long have I endured its guilt and shame!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Why? What remorse gnaws at your heart? What crime<br>
        Can have disturb’d you thus? Your hands are not<br>
        Polluted with the blood of innocence?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Thanks be to Heav’n, my hands are free from stain.<br>
        Would that my soul were innocent as they!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        What awful project have you then conceived,<br>
        Whereat your conscience should be still alarm’d?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Have I not said enough? Spare me the rest.<br>
        I die to save myself a full confession.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Die then, and keep a silence so inhuman;<br>
        But seek some other hand to close your eyes.<br>
        Tho’ but a spark of life remains within you,<br>
        My soul shall go before you to the Shades.<br>
        A thousand roads are always open thither;<br>
        Pain’d at your want of confidence, I’ll choose<br>
        The shortest. Cruel one, when has my faith<br>
        Deceived you! Think how in my arms you lay<br>
        New born. For you, my country and my children<br>
        I have forsaken. Do you thus repay<br>
        My faithful service?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        What do you expect<br>
      From words so bitter? Were I to break silence<br>
      Horror would freeze your blood.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        What can you say<br>
      To horrify me more than to behold<br>
      You die before my eyes?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        When you shall know<br>
      My crime, my death will follow none the less,<br>
      But with the added stain of guilt.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Dear Madam,<br>
      By all the tears that I have shed for you,<br>
      By these weak knees I clasp, relieve my mind<br>
      From torturing doubt.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        It is your wish. Then rise.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        I hear you. Speak.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Heav’ns! How shall I begin?
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      Dismiss vain fears, you wound me with distrust.

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        O fatal animosity of Venus!<br>
        Into what wild distractions did she cast<br>
        My mother!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Be they blotted from remembrance,<br>
      And for all time to come buried in silence.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        My sister Ariadne, by what love<br>
        Were you betray’d to death, on lonely shores<br>
        Forsaken!
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Madam, what deep-seated pain<br>
      Prompts these reproaches against all your kin?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        It is the will of Venus, and I perish,<br>
        Last, most unhappy of a family<br>
        Where all were wretched.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Do you love?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        I feel<br>
      All its mad fever.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Ah! For whom?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Hear now<br>
      The crowning horror. Yes, I love—my lips<br>
      Tremble to say his name.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Whom?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Know you him,<br>
      Son of the Amazon, whom I’ve oppress’d<br>
      So long?
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Hippolytus? Great gods!
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        ’Tis you<br>
      Have named him.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        All my blood within my veins<br>
      Seems frozen. O despair! O cursèd race!<br>
      Ill-omen’d journey! Land of misery!<br>
      Why did we ever reach thy dangerous shores?
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        My wound is not so recent. Scarcely had I<br>
        Been bound to Theseus by the marriage yoke,<br>
        And happiness and peace seem’d well secured,<br>
        When Athens show’d me my proud enemy.<br>
        I look’d, alternately turn’d pale and blush’d<br>
        To see him, and my soul grew all distraught;<br>
        A mist obscured my vision, and my voice<br>
        Falter’d, my blood ran cold, then burn’d like fire;<br>
        Venus I felt in all my fever’d frame,<br>
        Whose fury had so many of my race<br>
        Pursued. With fervent vows I sought to shun<br>
        Her torments, built and deck’d for her a shrine,<br>
        And there, ’mid countless victims did I seek<br>
        The reason I had lost; but all for naught,<br>
        No remedy could cure the wounds of love!<br>
        In vain I offer’d incense on her altars;<br>
        When I invoked her name my heart adored<br>
        Hippolytus, before me constantly;<br>
        And when I made her altars smoke with victims,<br>
        ’Twas for a god whose name I dared not utter.<br>
        I fled his presence everywhere, but found him—<br>
        O crowning horror!—in his father’s features.<br>
        Against myself, at last, I raised revolt,<br>
        And stirr’d my courage up to persecute<br>
        The enemy I loved. To banish him<br>
        I wore a step-dame’s harsh and jealous carriage,<br>
        With ceaseless cries I clamour’d for his exile,<br>
        Till I had torn him from his father’s arms.<br>
        I breathed once more, Œnone; in his absence<br>
        My days flow’d on less troubled than before,<br>
        And innocent. Submissive to my husband,<br>
        I hid my grief, and of our fatal marriage<br>
        Cherish’d the fruits. Vain caution! Cruel Fate!<br>
        Brought hither by my spouse himself, I saw<br>
        Again the enemy whom I had banish’d,<br>
        And the old wound too quickly bled afresh.<br>
        No longer is it love hid in my heart,<br>
        But Venus in her might seizing her prey.<br>
        I have conceived just terror for my crime;<br>
        I hate my life, and hold my love in horror.<br>
        Dying I wish’d to keep my fame unsullied,<br>
        And bury in the grave a guilty passion;<br>
        But I have been unable to withstand<br>
        Tears and entreaties, I have told you all;<br>
        Content, if only, as my end draws near,<br>
        You do not vex me with unjust reproaches,<br>
        Nor with vain efforts seek to snatch from death<br>
        The last faint lingering sparks of vital breath.

        Fain would I hide from you tidings so sad,<br>
        But ’tis my duty, Madam, to reveal them.<br>
        The hand of death has seized your peerless husband,<br>
        And you are last to hear of this disaster.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        What say you, Panope?
      </p>

      <em>Panope</em>

      <p>
        The queen, deceived<br>
      By a vain trust in Heav’n, begs safe return<br>
      For Theseus, while Hippolytus his son<br>
      Learns of his death from vessels that are now<br>
      In port.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        Ye gods!
      </p>

      <em>Panope</em>

      <p>
        Divided counsels sway<br>
      The choice of Athens; some would have the prince,<br>
      Your child, for master; others, disregarding<br>
      The laws, dare to support the stranger’s son.<br>
      ’Tis even said that a presumptuous faction<br>
      Would crown Aricia and the house of Pallas.<br>
      I deem’d it right to warn you of this danger.<br>
      Hippolytus already is prepared<br>
      To start, and should he show himself at Athens,<br>
      ’Tis to be fear’d the fickle crowd will all<br>
      Follow his lead.
      </p>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Enough. The queen, who hears you,<br>
      By no means will neglect this timely warning.

      <h2>Scene V</h2>

      <h3>PHÆDRA, ŒNONE</h3>

      <em>Œnone</em>

      <p>
        Dear lady, I had almost ceased to urge<br>
        The wish that you should live, thinking to follow<br>
        My mistress to the tomb, from which my voice<br>
        Had fail’d to turn you; but this new misfortune<br>
        Alters the aspect of affairs, and prompts<br>
        Fresh measures. Madam, Theseus is no more,<br>
        You must supply his place. He leaves a son,<br>
        A slave, if you should die, but, if you live,<br>
        A King. On whom has he to lean but you?<br>
        No hand but yours will dry his tears. Then live<br>
        For him, or else the tears of innocence<br>
        Will move the gods, his ancestors, to wrath<br>
        Against his mother. Live, your guilt is gone,<br>
        No blame attaches to your passion now.<br>
        The King’s decease has freed you from the bonds<br>
        That made the crime and horror of your love.<br>
        Hippolytus no longer need be dreaded,<br>
        Him you may see henceforth without reproach.<br>
        It may be, that, convinced of your aversion,<br>
        He means to head the rebels. Undeceive him,<br>
        Soften his callous heart, and bend his pride.<br>
        King of this fertile land, in Trœzen here<br>
        His portion lies; but as he knows, the laws<br>
        Give to your son the ramparts that Minerva<br>
        Built and protects. A common enemy<br>
        Threatens you both, unite them to oppose<br>
        Aricia.
      </p>

      <em>Phædra</em>

      <p>
        To your counsel I consent.<br>
        Yes, I will live, if life can be restored,<br>
        If my affection for a son has pow’r<br>
        To rouse my sinking heart at such a dangerous hour.
