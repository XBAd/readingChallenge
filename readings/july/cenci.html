          (1819) is a verse drama in five acts by Percy Bysshe Shelley written in the summer of 1819, and inspired by a real Italian family, the House of Cenci (in particular, Beatrice Cenci).
          Shelley composed the play in Rome and at Villa Valsovano near Livorno, from May to August 5, 1819.

      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene III</h2>

      <h3>A Magnificent Hall in the Cenci Palace. A Banquet.</h3>

      <em>Enter CENCI, LUCRETIA, BEATRICE, ORSINO, CAMILLO, NOBLES</em>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  Welcome, my friends and kinsmen; welcome ye, <br>
      Princes and Cardinals, pillars of the church,<br>
      Whose presence honours our festivity.<br>
      I have too long lived like an <span class="tooltip">anchorite<span class="tooltiptext">a religious recluse.</span></span>,<br>
      And in my absence from your merry meetings<br>
      An evil word is gone abroad of me;<br>
      But I do hope that you, my noble friends,<br>
      When you have shared the entertainment here,<br>
      And heard the pious cause for which ’tis given,<br>
      And we have pledged a health or two together,<br>
      Will think me flesh and blood as well as you;<br>
      Sinful indeed, for Adam made all so,<br>
      But tender-hearted, meek and pitiful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>First Guest.</em>  In truth, My Lord, you seem too light of heart,<br>
      Too sprightly and companionable a man,<br>
      To act the deeds that rumour pins on you.<br>
      (To his companion.) I never saw such blithe and open cheer<br>
      In any eye!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Second Guest.</em>  Some most desired event,<br>
      In which we all demand a common joy,<br>
      Has brought us hither; let us hear it, Count.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  It is indeed a most desired event.<br>
      If, when a parent from a parent’s heart<br>
      Lifts from this earth to the great father of all<br>
      A prayer, both when he lays him down to sleep,<br>
      And when he rises up from dreaming it;<br>
      One <span class="tooltip">supplication<span class="tooltiptext">the action of asking or begging for something earnestly or humbly.</span></span>, one desire, one hope,<br>
      That he would grant a wish for his two sons,<br>
      Even all that he demands in their regard—<br>
      And suddenly beyond his dearest hope,<br>
      It is accomplished, he should then rejoice,<br>
      And call his friends and kinsmen to a feast,<br>
      And task their love to grace his merriment,<br>
      Then honour me thus far—for I am he.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice  (to Lucretia).</em> Great God! How horrible! Some dreadful ill<br>
      Must have befallen my brothers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>                Fear not, Child,<br>
      He speaks too frankly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>                Ah! My blood runs cold.<br>
      I fear that wicked laughter round his eye,<br>
      Which wrinkles up the skin even to the hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  Here are the letters brought from Salamanca;<br>
      Beatrice, read them to your mother. God!<br>
      I thank thee! In one night didst thou perform,<br>
      By ways inscrutable, the thing I sought.<br>
      My disobedient and rebellious sons<br>
      Are dead!—Why, dead!—What means this change of cheer?<br>
      You hear me not, I tell you they are dead;<br>
      And they will need no food or <span class="tooltip">raiment<span class="tooltiptext">clothing.</span></span> more:<br>
      The tapers that did light them the dark way<br>
      Are their last cost. The Pope, I think, will not<br>
      Expect I should maintain them in their coffins.<br>
      Rejoice with me—my heart is wondrous glad.  [LUCRETIA sinks, half-fainting; BEATRICE supports her.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>  It is not true!—Dear lady, pray look up.<br>
      Had it been true, there is a God in Heaven,<br>
      He would not live to boast of such a <span class="tooltip">boon<span class="tooltiptext">a thing that is helpful or beneficial.</span></span>.<br>
      Unnatural man, thou knowest that it is false.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  Ay, as the word of God; whom here I call<br>
      To witness that I speak the sober truth;—<br>
      And whose most favouring Providence was shown<br>
      Even in the manner of their deaths. For Rocco<br>
      Was kneeling at the mass, with sixteen others,<br>
      When the church fell and crushed him to a mummy,<br>
      The rest escaped unhurt. Cristofano<br>
      Was stabbed in error by a jealous man,<br>
      Whilst she he loved was sleeping with his rival;<br>
      All in the self-same hour of the same night;<br>
      Which shows that Heaven has special care of me.<br>
      I beg those friends who love me, that they mark<br>
      The day a feast upon their calendars.<br>
      It was the twenty-seventh of December:<br>
      Ay, read the letters if you doubt my oath.  [The Assembly appears confused; several of the guests rise.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>First Guest.</em>  Oh, horrible! I will depart—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Second Guest.</em>                And I.—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Third Guest.</em>                No, stay!<br>
      I do believe it is some jest; tho’ faith!<br>
      ’Tis mocking us somewhat too solemnly.<br>
      I think his son has married the Infanta,<br>
      Or found a mine of gold in El Dorado;<br>
      ’Tis but to season some such news; stay, stay!<br>
      I see ’tis only raillery by his smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci  (filling a bowl of wine, and lifting it up).</em> Oh, thou<br>
      bright wine whose purple splendour leaps<br>
      And bubbles gaily in this golden bowl<br>
      Under the lamp-light, as my spirits do,<br>
      To hear the death of my accursèd sons!<br>
      Could I believe thou wert their mingled blood,<br>
      Then would I taste thee like a sacrament,<br>
      And pledge with thee the mighty Devil in Hell,<br>
      Who, if a father’s curses, as men say,<br>
      Climb with swift wings after their children’s souls,<br>
      And drag them from the very throne of Heaven,<br>
      Now triumphs in my triumph!—But thou art<br>
      Superfluous; I have drunken deep of joy,<br>
      And I will taste no other wine to-night.<br>
      Here, Andrea! Bear the bowl around.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>A Guest (rising).</em>                Thou wretch!<br>
      Will none among this noble company<br>
      Check the abandoned villain?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Camillo.</em>                For God’s sake<br>
      Let me dismiss the guests! You are insane,<br>
      Some ill will come of this.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Second Guest.</em>                Seize, silence him!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>First Guest.</em>  I will!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Third Guest.</em>        And I!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci (addressing those who rise with a threatening gesture).</em>                Who moves? Who speaks? (turning to the Company)<br>
                      ’tis nothing,<br>
      Enjoy yourselves.—Beware! For my revenge<br>
      Is as the sealed commission of a king<br>
      That kills, and none dare name the murderer.  [The Banquet is broken up; several of the Guests are departing.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>  I do entreat you, go not, noble guests;<br>
      What, although tyranny and impious hate<br>
      Stand sheltered by a father’s <span class="tooltip">hoary<span class="tooltiptext">grayish white.</span></span> hair,<br>
      What, if ’tis he who clothed us in these limbs<br>
      Who tortures them, and triumphs? What, if we,<br>
      The desolate and the dead, were his own flesh,<br>
      His children and his wife, whom he is bound<br>
      To love and shelter? Shall we therefore find<br>
      No refuge in this merciless wide world?<br>
      O think what deep wrongs must have blotted out<br>
      First love, then reverence in a child’s prone mind,<br>
      Till it thus vanquish shame and fear! O think!<br>
      I have borne much, and kissed the sacred hand<br>
      Which crushed us to the earth, and thought its stroke<br>
      Was perhaps some paternal chastisement!<br>
      Have excused much, doubted; and when no doubt<br>
      Remained, have sought by patience, love, and tears<br>
      To soften him, and when this could not be<br>
      I have knelt down through the long sleepless nights<br>
      And lifted up to God, the father of all,<br>
      Passionate prayers: and when these were not heard<br>
      I have still borne,—until I meet you here,<br>
      Princes and kinsmen, at this hideous feast<br>
      Given at my brothers’ deaths. Two yet remain,<br>
      His wife remains and I, whom if ye save not,<br>
      Ye may soon share such merriment again<br>
      As fathers make over their children’s graves.<br>
      O Prince Colonna, thou art our near kinsman,<br>
      Cardinal, thou art the Pope’s <span class="tooltip">chamberlain<span class="tooltiptext">the officer in charge of managing the household of a sovereign or other noble figure</span></span>,<br>
      Camillo, thou art chief justiciary,<br>
      Take us away!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  (He has been conversing with CAMILLO during the first part of BEATRICE’S speech; he hears the conclusion, and now advances.)              I hope my good friends here <br>
      Will think of their own daughters—or perhaps <br>
      Of their own throats—before they lend an ear <br>
      To this wild girl.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice  (not noticing the words of Cenci).</em>                Dare no one look on me?<br>
      None answer? Can one tyrant overbear<br>
      The sense of many best and wisest men?<br>
      Or is it that I sue not in some form<br>
      Of scrupulous law, that ye deny my suit?<br>
      O God! That I were buried with my brothers!<br>
      And that the flowers of this departed spring<br>
      Were fading on my grave! And that my father<br>
      Were celebrating now one feast for all!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Camillo.</em>  A bitter wish for one so young and gentle;<br>
      Can we do nothing?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Colonna.</em>                Nothing that I see.<br>
      Count Cenci were a dangerous enemy:<br>
      Yet I would second any one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>A Cardinal.</em>                And I.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  Retire to your chamber, insolent girl!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>  Retire thou impious man! Ay, hide thyself<br>
      Where never eye can look upon thee more!<br>
      Wouldst thou have honour and obedience<br>
      Who art a torturer? Father, never dream<br>
      Though thou must overbear this company,<br>
      But ill must come of ill.—Frown not on me!<br>
      Haste, hide thyself, lest with avenging looks<br>
      My brothers’ ghosts should hunt thee from thy seat!<br>
      Cover thy face from every living eye,<br>
      And start if thou but hear a human step.<br>
      Seek out some dark and silent corner, there<br>
      Bow thy white head before offended God,<br>
      And we will kneel around, and fervently<br>
      Pray that he pity both ourselves, and thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  My friends, I do lament this insane girl<br>
      Has spoilt the mirth of our festivity.<br>
      Good night, farewell; I will not make you longer<br>
      Spectators of our dull domestic quarrels.<br>
      Another time.—  [Exeunt all but CENCI and BEATRICE.]<br>
                      My brain is swimming round;<br>
      Give me a bowl of wine!  [To BEATRICE.]<br>
                      Thou painted viper!<br>
      Beast that thou art! Fair and yet terrible!<br>
      I know a charm shall make thee meek and tame,<br>
      Now get thee from my sight!  [Exit BEATRICE.]<br>
                      Here, Andrea,<br>
      Fill up this goblet with Greek wine. I said<br>
      I would not drink this evening; but I must;<br>
      For, strange to say, I feel my spirits fail<br>
      With thinking what I have decreed to do.—  [Drinking the wine.]<br>
      Be thou the resolution of quick youth<br>
      Within my veins, and manhood’s purpose stern,<br>
      And age’s firm, cold, subtle villainy;<br>
      As if thou wert indeed my children’s blood<br>
      Which I did thirst to drink! The charm works well;<br>
      It must be done; it shall be done, I swear!  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <h2>Act II</h2>

      <h2>Scene I</h2>

      <h3>An Apartment in the Cenci Palace.</h3>

      <em>Enter LUCRETIA and BERNARDO</em>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  Weep not, my gentle boy; he struck but me<br>
      Who have borne deeper wrongs. In truth, if he<br>
      Had killed me, he had done a kinder deed.<br>
      O, God Almighty, do thou look upon us,<br>
      We have no other friend but only thee!<br>
      Yet weep not; though I love you as my own,<br>
      I am not your true mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Bernardo.</em>                O more, more,<br>
      Than ever mother was to any child,<br>
      That have you been to me! Had he not been<br>
      My father, do you think that I should weep!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  Alas! Poor boy, what else couldst thou have done?
      </p>

      <em>Enter BEATRICE</em>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice  (in a hurried voice).</em> Did he pass this way? Have you seen him, brother?<br>
      Ah! No, that is his step upon the stairs;<br>
      ’Tis nearer now; his hand in on the door;<br>
      Mother, if I to thee have ever been<br>
      A duteous child, now save me! Thou, great God,<br>
      Whose image upon earth a father is,<br>
      Dost thou indeed abandon me? He comes:<br>
      The door is opening now; I see his face;<br>
      He frowns on others, but he smiles on me,<br>
      Even as he did after the feast last night.
      </p>

      <em>Enter a Servant</em>

      <p>
        Almighty God, how merciful thou art!<br>
      ’Tis but Orsino’s servant.—Well, what news?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Servant.</em>  My master bids me say, the Holy Father<br>
      Has sent back your petition thus unopened.  [Giving a paper.]<br>
      And he demands at what hour ’twere secure<br>
      To visit you again?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>                At the Ave Mary.  [Exit Servant.]<br>
      So daughter, our last hope has failed; Ah me!<br>
      How pale you look; you tremble, and you stand<br>
      Wrapped in some fixed and fearful meditation,<br>
      As if one thought were over strong for you:<br>
      Your eyes have a chill glare; O, dearest child!<br>
      Are you gone mad? If not, pray speak to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>  You see I am not mad: I speak to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  You talked of something that your father did<br>
      After that dreadful feast? Could it be worse<br>
      Than when he smiled, and cried, My sons are dead!<br>
      And every one looked in his neighbour’s face<br>
      To see if others were as white as he?<br>
      At the first word he spoke I felt the blood<br>
      Rush to my heart, and fell into a trance;<br>
      And when it passed I sat all weak and wild;<br>
      Whilst you alone stood up, and with strong words<br>
      Checked his unnatural pride; and I could see<br>
      The devil was rebuked that lives in him.<br>
      Until this hour thus have you ever stood<br>
      Between us and your father’s moody wrath<br>
      Like a protecting presence: your firm mind<br>
      Has been our only refuge and defence.<br>
      What can have thus subdued it? What can now<br>
      Have given you that cold melancholy look,<br>
      Succeeding to your unaccustomed fear?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>  What is it that you say? I was just thinking<br>
      ’Twere better not to struggle any more.<br>
      Men, like my father, have been dark and bloody,<br>
      Yet never—Oh! Before worse comes of it<br>
      ’Twere wise to die: it ends in that at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  O talk not so, dear child! Tell me at once<br>
      What did your father do or say to you?<br>
      He stayed not after that accursèd feast<br>
      One moment in your chamber.—Speak to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Bernardo.</em>  O sister, sister, prithee, speak to us!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice  (speaking very slowly with a forced calmness).</em> It was one word, Mother, one little word;<br>
      One look, one smile. (Wildly.) Oh! He has trampled me<br>
      Under his feet, and made the blood stream down<br>
      My pallid cheeks. And he has given us all<br>
      Ditch water, and the fever-stricken flesh<br>
      Of buffaloes, and bade us eat or starve,<br>
      And we have eaten.—He has made me look<br>
      On my beloved Bernardo, when the rust<br>
      Of heavy chains has gangrened his sweet limbs,<br>
      And I have never yet despaired—but now!<br>
      What could I say?  [Recovering herself.]<br>
                      Ah! No, ’tis nothing new.<br>
      The sufferings we all share have made me wild:<br>
      He only struck and cursed me as he passed;<br>
      He said, he looked, he did;—nothing at all<br>
      Beyond his wont, yet it disordered me.<br>
      Alas! I am forgetful of my duty,<br>
      I should preserve my senses for your sake.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  Nay, Beatrice! have courage, my sweet girl,<br>
      If any one despairs it should be I<br>
      Who loved him once, and now must live with him<br>
      Till God in pity call for him or me.<br>
      For you may, like your sister, find some husband,<br>
      And smile, years hence, with children round your knees;<br>
      Whilst I, then dead, and all this hideous coil<br>
      Shall be remembered only as a dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice.</em>  Talk not to me, dear lady, of a husband.<br>
      Did you not nurse me when my mother died?<br>
      Did you not shield me and that dearest boy?<br>
      And had we any other friend but you<br>
      In infancy, with gentle words and looks,<br>
      To win our father not to murder us?<br>
      And shall I now desert you? May the ghost<br>
      Of my dead Mother plead against my soul<br>
      If I abandon her who filled the place<br>
      She left, with more, even, than a mother’s love!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Bernardo.</em>  And I am of my sister’s mind. Indeed<br>
      I would not leave you in this wretchedness,<br>
      Even though the Pope should make me free to live<br>
      In some blithe place, like others of my age,<br>
      With sports, and delicate food, and the fresh air.<br>
      O never think that I will leave you, Mother!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  My dear, dear children!
      </p>

      <em>Enter CENCI suddenly</em>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>                What, Beatrice here!<br>
      Come hither!  [She shrinks back, and covers her face.]<br>
                    Nay, hide not your face, ’tis fair;<br>
      Look up! Why, yesternight you dared to look<br>
      With disobedient insolence upon me,<br>
      Bending a stern and an inquiring brow<br>
      On what I meant; whilst I then sought to hide<br>
      That which I came to tell you—but in vain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Beatrice  (wildly, staggering towards the door).</em> O that the earth would gape! Hide me, O God!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  Then it was I whose inarticulate words<br>
      Fell from my lips, and who with tottering steps<br>
      Fled from your presence, as you now from mine.<br>
      Stay, I command you—from this day and hour<br>
      Never again, I think, with fearless eye,<br>
      And brow superior, and unaltered cheek,<br>
      And that lip made for tenderness or scorn,<br>
      Shalt thou strike dumb the meanest of mankind;<br>
      Me least of all. Now get thee to thy chamber!<br>
      Thou too, loathed image of thy cursed mother,  [To BERNARDO.]<br>
      Thy milky, meek face makes me sick with hate!  [Exeunt BEATRICE and BERNARDO.]<br>
      (Aside.) So much has past between us as must make<br>
      Me bold, her fearful.—’Tis an awful thing<br>
      To touch such mischief as I now conceive:<br>
      So men sit shivering on the dewy bank,<br>
      And try the chill stream with their feet; once in…<br>
      How the delighted spirit pants for joy!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia  (advancing timidly towards him).</em> O husband! Pray forgive poor Beatrice.<br>
      She meant not any ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>                Nor you perhaps?<br>
      Nor that young imp, whom you have taught by rote<br>
      Parricide with his alphabet? Nor Giacomo?<br>
      Nor those two must unnatural sons, who stirred<br>
      Enmity up against me with the Pope?<br>
      Whom in one night merciful God cut off:<br>
      Innocent lambs! They thought not any ill.<br>
      You were not here conspiring? You said nothing<br>
      Of how I might be dungeoned as a madman;<br>
      Or be condemned to death for some offence,<br>
      And you would be the witness?—This failing,<br>
      How just it were to hire assassins, or<br>
      Put sudden poison in my evening drink?<br>
      Or smother me when overcome by wine?<br>
      Seeing we had no other judge but God,<br>
      And he had sentenced me, and there were none<br>
      But you to be the executioners<br>
      Of this decree enregistered in heaven?<br>
      Oh, no! You said not this?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>                So help me God,<br>
      I never thought the things you charge me with!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  If you dare speak that wicked lie again<br>
      I’ll kill you. What! It was not by your counsel<br>
      That Beatrice disturbed the feast last night?<br>
      You did not hope to stir some enemies<br>
      Against me, and escape, and laugh to scorn<br>
      What every nerve of you now trembles at?<br>
      You judged that men were bolder than they are;<br>
      Few dare to stand between their grave and me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lucretia.</em>  Look not so dreadfully! By my salvation<br>
      I knew not aught that Beatrice designed;<br>
      Nor do I think she designed any thing<br>
      Until she heard you talk of her dead brothers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cenci.</em>  Blaspheming liar! You are damned for his!<br>
      But I will take you where you may persuade<br>
      The stones you tread on to deliver you:<br>
      For men shall there be none but those who dare<br>
      All things—not question that which I command.<br>
      On Wednesday next I shall set out: you know<br>
      That savage rock, the Castle of Petrella:<br>
      ’Tis safely walled, and moated round about:<br>
      Its dungeons underground, and its thick towers<br>
      Never told tales; though they have heard and seen<br>
      What might make dumb things speak.—Why do you linger?<br>
      Make speediest preparation for the journey!  [Exit LUCRETIA.]<br>
      The all-beholding sun yet shines; I hear<br>
      A busy stir of men about the streets;<br>
      I see the bright sky through the window panes:<br>
      It is a garish, broad, and peering day;<br>
      Loud, light, suspicious, full of eyes and ears,<br>
      And every little corner, nook, and hole<br>
      Is penetrated with the insolent light.<br>
      Come darkness! Yet, what is the day to me?<br>
      And wherefore should I wish for night, who do<br>
      A deed which shall confound both night and day?<br>
      ’Tis she shall grope through a bewildering mist<br>
      Of horror: if there be a sun in heaven<br>
      She shall not dare to look upon its beams;<br>
      Nor feel its warmth. Let her then wish for night;<br>
      The act I think shall soon extinguish all<br>
      For me: I bear a darker deadlier gloom<br>
      Than the earth’s shade, or interlunar air,<br>
      Or constellations quenched in murkiest cloud,<br>
      In which I walk secure and unbeheld<br>
      Towards my purpose.—Would that it were done!  [Exit.]
