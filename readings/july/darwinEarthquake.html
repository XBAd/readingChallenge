          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Beagle" target="_blank">Charles Darwin's <em>Voyage of the Beagle</em></a>,
          published in 1839, covers Darwin's part in the second survey expedition of the ship HMS Beagle.
          The book is a vivid travel memoir as well as a detailed scientific field journal covering biology, geology, and anthropology that
          demonstrates Darwin's keen powers of observation, written at a time when Western Europeans were exploring and charting the whole world.
          Darwin's notes made during the voyage include comments hinting at his changing views on the fixity of species.
          On his return, he wrote the book based on these notes, at a time when he was first developing his theories of evolution through common descent and natural selection.

        <em>March 4th.</em> — We entered the harbour of Concepcion. While the
ship was beating up to the anchorage, I landed on the island of Quiriquina. The mayor-domo of the estate quickly rode down to
tell me the terrible news of the great earthquake of the 20th: —
"That not a house in Concepcion or Talcahuano (the port) was
standing; that seventy villages were destroyed; and that a great wave had almost washed away the ruins of Talcahuano." Of this
latter statement I soon saw abundant proofs — the whole coast being
strewed over with timber and furniture as if a thousand ships had
been wrecked. Besides chairs, tables, book-shelves, etc., in great
numbers, there were several roofs of cottages, which had been transported almost whole. The storehouses at Talcahuano had been burst open, and great bags of cotton, yerba, and other valuable merchandise
were scattered on the shore. During my walk round the island,
I observed that numerous fragments of rock, which, from the marine
productions adhering to them, must recently have been lying
in deep water, had been cast up high on the beach; one of these was six feet long, three broad, and two thick.
      </p>

      <p>
        The island itself as plainly showed the overwhelming power of
the earthquake, as the beach did that of the consequent great wave. The ground in many parts was fissured in north and south lines,
perhaps caused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of this narrow island. Some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide.
Many enormous masses had already fallen on the beach; and the
inhabitants thought that when the rains commenced far greater
slips would happen. The effect of the vibration on the hard primary
slate, which composes the foundation of the island, was still more
curious: the superficial parts of some narrow ridges were as completely
shivered as if they had been blasted by gunpowder. This
effect, which was rendered conspicuous by the fresh fractures and
displaced soil, must be confined to near the surface, for otherwise
there would not exist a block of solid rock throughout Chile; nor
is this improbable, as it is known that the surface of a vibrating body
is affected differently from the central part. It is, perhaps, owing to
this same reason, that earthquakes do not cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would be expected. I believe this convulsion
has been more effectual in lessening the size of the island of
Quinquina, than the ordinary wear-and-tear of the sea and weather
during the course of a whole century.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day I landed at Talcahuano, and afterwards rode to Concepcion. Both towns presented the most awful yet interesting
spectacle I ever beheld. To a person who had formerly known them,
it possibly might have been still more impressive; for the ruins were so mingled together, and the whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place, that it was scarcely possible to imagine
its former condition. The earthquake commenced at half-past eleven
o'clock in the forenoon. If it had happened in the middle of the
night, the greater number of the inhabitants (which in this one
province must amount to many thousands) must have perished, instead of less than a hundred: as it was, the invariable practice of running out of doors at the first trembling of the ground, alone saved them. In Concepcion each house, or row of houses, stood by itself, a heap or line of ruins; but in Talcahuano, owing to the great wave, little more than one layer of bricks, tiles, and timber,
with here and there part of a wall left standing, could be distinguished. From this circumstance Concepcion, although not so completely
desolated, was a more terrible, and if I may so call it, picturesque
sight. The first shock was very sudden. The mayor-domo
at Quiriquina told me, that the first notice he received of it, was
finding both the horse he rode and himself, roiling together on the ground. Rising up, he was again thrown down. He also told me
that some cows which were standing on the steep side of the island were rolled into the sea. The great wave caused the destruction of many cattle; on one low island, near the head of the bay, seventy
animals were washed off and drowned. It is generally thought that
this has been the worst earthquake ever recorded in Chile; but as the very severe ones occur only after long intervals, this cannot easily
be known; nor indeed would a much worse shock have made any
difference, for the ruin was now complete. Innumerable small tremblings followed the great earthquake, and within the first twelve days no less than three hundred were counted.
      </p>

      <p>
        After viewing Concepcion, I cannot understand how the greater
number of inhabitants escaped unhurt. The houses in many parts
fell outwards; thus forming in the middle of the streets little hillocks of brickwork and rubbish. Mr. Rouse, the English consul, told us
that he was at breakfast when the first movement warned him to run out. He had scarcely reached the middle of the court-yard, when
one side of his house came thundering down. He retained presence of mind to remember, that if he once got on the top of that part
which had already fallen, he would be safe. Not being able from
the motion of the ground to stand, he crawled up on his hands and
knees; and no sooner had he ascended this little eminence, than the other side of the house fell in, the great beams sweeping close in front of his head. With his eyes blinded, and his mouth choked with
the cloud of dust which darkened the sky, at last he gained the
street. As shock succeeded shock, at the interval of a few minutes, no one dared approach the shattered ruins; and no one knew whether
his dearest friends and relations were not perishing from the want
of help. Those who had saved any property were obliged to keep
a constant watch, for thieves prowled about, and at each little trembling
of the ground, with one hand they beat their breasts and cried "Misericordia!" and then with the other filched what they could
from the ruins. The thatched roofs fell over the fires, and flames
burst forth in all parts. Hundreds knew themselves ruined, and
few had the means of providing food for the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the prosperity of any
country. If beneath England the now inert subterranean forces should exert those powers, which most assuredly in former geological ages they have exerted, how completely would the entire condition
of the country be changed! What would become of the lofty houses,
thickly packed cities, great manufactories, the beautiful public and
private edifices? If the new period of disturbance were first to commence by some great earthquake in the dead of the night, how
terrific would be the carnage! England would at once be bankrupt;
all papers, records, and accounts would from that moment be lost. Government being unable to collect the taxes, and failing to maintain
its authority, the hand of violence and rapine would remain
uncontrolled. In every large town famine would go forth, pestilence
and death following in its train.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after the shock, a great wave was seen from the distance
of three or four miles, approaching in the middle of the bay with a smooth outline; but along the shore it tore up cottages and trees, as
it swept onwards with irresistible force. At the head of the bay it broke in a fearful line of white breakers, which rushed up to a
height of 23 vertical feet above the highest spring-tides. Their force must have been prodigious; for at the Fort a cannon with its carriage,
estimated at four tons in weight, was moved 15 feet inwards.
A schooner was left in the midst of the ruins, 200 yards from the
beach. The first wave was followed by two others, which in their
retreat carried away a vast wreck of floating objects. In one part of
the bay, a ship was pitched high and dry on shore, was carried off, again driven on shore, and again carried off. In another part, two
large vessels anchored near together were whirled about, and their cables were thrice wound round each other; though anchored at a depth of 36 feet, they were for some minutes aground. The great wave must have travelled slowly, for the inhabitants of Talcahuano
had time to run up the hills behind the town; and some sailors pulled out seaward, trusting successfully to their boat riding securely over the swell, if they could reach it before it broke. One old woman
with a little boy, four or five years old, ran into a boat, but there was nobody to row it out: the boat was consequently dashed against an anchor and cut in twain; the old woman was drowned, but the
child was picked up some hours afterwards clinging to the wreck.
Pools of salt-water were still standing amidst the ruins of the houses,
and children, making boats with old tables and chairs, appeared as happy as their parents were miserable. It was, however, exceedingly
interesting to observe, how much more active and cheerful all appeared than could have been expected. It was remarked with much
truth, that from the destruction being universal, no one individual was humbled more than another, or could suspect his friends of coldness — that most grievous result of the loss of wealth. Mr. Rouse,
and a large party whom he kindly took under his protection, lived for the first week in a garden beneath some apple-trees. At first they were as merry as if it had been a picnic; but soon afterwards
heavy rain caused much discomfort, for they were absolutely without shelter.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Captain Fitz Roy's excellent account of the earthquake, it is said that two explosions, one like a column of smoke and another
like the blowing of a great whale, were seen in the bay. The water
also appeared everywhere to be boiling; and it "became black, and
exhaled a most disagreeable sulphureous smell." These latter circumstances were observed in the Bay of Valparaiso during the earthquake of 1822; they may, I think, be accounted for, by the disturbance of the mud at the bottom of the sea containing organic matter in decay. In the Bay of Callao, during a calm day, I noticed, that as the ship dragged her cable over the bottom, its course was marked by a line of bubbles. The lower orders in Talcahuano
thought that the earthquake was caused by some old Indian women,
who two years ago, being offended, stopped the volcano of Antuco.
This silly belief is curious, because it shows that experience has taught them to observe, that there exists a relation between the suppressed
action of the volcanos, and the trembling of the ground. It was necessary to apply the witchcraft to the point where their perception of cause and effect failed; and this was the closing of the
volcanic vent. This belief is the more singular in this particular
instance, because, according to Captain Fitz Roy, there is reason to believe that Antuco was noways affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        The town of Concepcion was built in the usual Spanish fashion,
with all the streets running at right angles to each other; one set ranging S.W. by W., and the other set N.W. by N. The walls in
the former direction certainly stood better than those in the latter; the greater number of the masses of brickwork were thrown down
towards the N.E. Both these circumstances perfectly agree with the
general idea, of the undulations having come from the S.W., in which quarter subterranean noises were also heard; for it is evident
that the walls running S.W. and N.E. which presented their ends
to the point whence the undulations came, would be much less
likely to fall than those walls which, running N.W. and S.E., must
in their whole lengths have been at the same instant thrown out of
the perpendicular; for the undulations, coming from the S.W., must
have extended in N.W. and S.E. waves, as they passed under the
foundations. This may be illustrated by placing books edgeways on a carpet, and then, after the manner suggested by Michell, imitating
the undulations of an earthquake: it will be found that they
fall with more or less readiness, according as their direction more
or less nearly coincides with the line of the waves. The fissures in
the ground generally, though not uniformly, extended in a S.E. and N.W. direction, and therefore corresponded to the lines of undulation
or of principal flexure. Bearing in mind all these circumstances,
which so clearly point to the S.W. as the chief focus of
disturbance, it is a very interesting fact that the island of S. Maria,
situated in that quarter, was, during the general uplifting of the
land, raised to nearly three times the height of any other part of
the coast.
      </p>

      <p>
        The different resistance offered by the walls, according to their
direction, was well exemplified in the case of the Cathedral. The
side which fronted the N.E. presented a grand pile of ruins, in the midst of which door-cases and masses of timber stood up, as if floating in a stream. Some of the angular blocks of brickwork were of great dimensions; and they were rolled to a distance on the level plaza, like fragments of rock at the base of some high mountain.
The side walls (running S.W. and N.E.), though exceedingly fractured, yet remained standing; but the vast buttresses (at right angles
to them, and therefore parallel to the walls that fell) were in many
cases cut clean off, as if by a chisel, and hurled to the ground. Some
square ornaments on the coping of these same walls, were moved by
the earthquake into a diagonal position. A similar circumstance was
observed after an earthquake at Valparaiso, Calabria, and other
places, including some of the ancient Greek temples. This twisting displacement, at first appears to indicate a <span class="tooltip">vorticose<span class="tooltiptext">of or relating to a vortex; whirling</span></span> movement
beneath each point thus affected; but this is highly improbable. May
it not be caused by a tendency in each stone to arrange itself in some particular position, with respect to the lines of vibration, —
in a manner somewhat similar to pins on a sheet of paper when
shaken? Generally speaking, arched doorways or windows stood much better than any other part of the buildings. Nevertheless, a poor lame old man, who had been in the habit, during trifling
shocks, of crawling to a certain doorway, was this time crushed
to pieces.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have not attempted to give any detailed description of the appearance of Concepcion, for I feel that it is quite impossible to convey the mingled feelings which I experienced. Several of the
officers visited it before me, but their strongest language failed to give a just idea of the scene of desolation. It is a bitter and humiliating
thing to see works, which have cost man so much time and
labour, overthrown in one minute; yet compassion for the inhabitants was almost instantly banished, by the surprise in seeing a
state of things produced in a moment of time, which one was accustomed to attribute to a succession of ages. In my opinion, we have
scarcely beheld, since leaving England, any sight so deeply interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        In almost every severe earthquake, the neighbouring waters of the sea are said to have been greatly agitated. The disturbance seems generally, as in the case of Concepcion, to have been of two
kinds: first, at the instant of the shock, the water swells high up on
the beach with a gentle motion, and then as quietly retreats; secondly, some time afterwards, the whole body of the sea retires from the coast, and then returns in waves of overwhelming force. The first movement seems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake affecting differently a fluid and a solid, so that their respective levels are slightly deranged: but the second case is a far more important phenomenon. During most earthquakes, and especially
during those on the west coast of America, it is certain that
the first great movement of the waters has been a retirement. Some
authors have attempted to explain this, by supposing that the water
retains its level, whilst the land oscillates upwards; but surely the water close to the land, even on a rather steep coast, would partake
of the motion of the bottom: moreover, as urged by Mr. Lyell, similar movements of the sea have occurred at islands far distant from the chief line of disturbance, as was the case with Juan Fernandez during this earthquake, and with Madeira during the famous
Lisbon shock. I suspect (but the subject is a very obscure one) that
a wave, however produced, first draws the water from the shore, on
which it is advancing to break: I have observed that this happens
with the little waves from the paddles of a steam-boat. It is remarkable that whilst Talcahuano and Callao (near Lima), both
situated at the head of large shallow bays, have suffered during
every severe earthquake from great waves, Valparaiso, seated close to the edge of profoundly deep water, has never been overwhelmed,
though so often shaken by the severest shocks. From the great wave
not immediately following the earthquake, but sometimes after the
interval of even half an hour, and from distant islands being affected
similarly with the coasts near the focus of the disturbance, it appears that the wave first rises in the offing; and as this is of general
occurrence, the cause must be general: I suspect we must look to the line, where the less disturbed waters of the deep ocean join the water nearer the coast, which has partaken of the movements of
the land, as the place where the great wave is first generated; it would also appear that the wave is larger or smaller, according to the extent of shoal water which has been agitated together with the bottom on which it rested.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most remarkable effect of this earthquake was the permanent
elevation of the land; it would probably be far more correct to speak of it as the cause. There can be no doubt that the land round
the Bay of Concepcion was upraised two or three feet; but it deserves
notice, that owing to the wave having obliterated the old lines of
tidal action on the sloping sandy shores, I could discover no evidence
of this fact, except in the united testimony of the inhabitants, that one little rocky shoal, now exposed, was formerly covered with water. At the island of S. Maria (about thirty miles distant) the elevation was greater; on one part, Captain Fitz Roy found beds of putrid
mussel-shells still adhering to the rocks, ten feet above high-water
mark: the inhabitants had formerly dived at lower-water <span class="tooltip">springtides<span class="tooltiptext">a tide just after a new or full moon, when there is the greatest difference between high and low water.</span></span>
for these shells. The elevation of this province is particularly
interesting, from its having been the theatre of several other violent earthquakes, and from the vast numbers of sea-shells scattered over the land, up to a height of certainly 600, and I believe, of 1000 feet. At Valparaiso, as I have remarked, similar shells are found at the height of 1300 feet: it is hardly possible to doubt that this great elevation has been effected by successive small uprisings, such as that which accompanied or caused the earthquake of this year, and
likewise by an insensibly slow rise, which is certainly in progress on some parts of this coast.
      </p>

      <p>
        The island of Juan Fernandez, 360 miles to the N.E., was, at the time of the great shock of the 20th, violently shaken, so that the
trees beat against each other, and a volcano burst forth under water
close to the shore: these facts are remarkable because this island,
during the earthquake of 1751, was then also affected more violently
than other places at an equal distance from Concepcion, and
this seems to show some subterranean connection between these two
points. Chiloe, about 340 miles southward of Concepcion, appears
to have been shaken more strongly than the intermediate district of Valdivia, where the volcano of Villarica was noways affected,
whilst in the Cordillera in front of Chiloe, two of the volcanos burst
forth at the same instant in violent action. These two volcanos, and some neighbouring ones, continued for a long time in eruption, and
ten months afterwards were again influenced by an earthquake at Concepcion. Some men, cutting wood near the base of one of these
volcanos, did not perceive the shock of the 20th, although the whole
surrounding Province was then trembling; here we have an eruption
relieving and taking the place of an earthquake, as would have happened
at Concepcion, according to the belief of the lower orders, if the volcano at Antuco had not been closed by witchcraft. Two years and three-quarters afterwards, Valdivia and Chiloe were again
shaken, more violently than on the 20th, and an island in the Chonos
Archipelago was permanently elevated more than eight feet. It will give a better idea of the scale of these phenomena, if (as in the
case of the glaciers) we suppose them to have taken place at corresponding distances in Europe: — then would the land from the
North Sea to the Mediterranean have been violently shaken, and
at the same instant of time a large tract of the eastern coast of England
would have been permanently elevated, together with some
outlying islands, — a train of volcanos on the coast of Holland would
have burst forth in action, and an eruption taken place at the bottom
of the sea, near the northern extremity of Ireland — and lastly, the ancient vents of Auvergne, Cantal, and Mont d'Or would each have
sent up to the sky a dark column of smoke, and have long remained
in fierce action. Two years and three-quarters afterwards, France,
from its centre to the English Channel, would have been again
desolated by an earthquake, and an island permanently upraised
in the Mediterranean.
      </p>

      <p>
        The space, from under which volcanic matter on the 20th was
actually erupted, is 720 miles in one line, and 400 miles in another
line at right angles to the first: hence, in all probability, a subterranean lake of lava is here stretched out, of nearly double the
area of the Black Sea. From the intimate and complicated manner
in which the elevatory and eruptive forces were shown to be connected
during this train of phenomena, we may confidently come to the conclusion, that the forces which slowly and by little starts uplift
continents, and those which at successive periods pour forth volcanic matter from open orifices, are identical. From many reasons, I believe that the frequent quakings of the earth on this line of coast are caused by the rending of the strata, necessarily consequent on the tension of the land when upraised, and their injection by fluidified rock. This rending and injection would, if repeated often enough
(and we know that earthquakes repeatedly affect the same areas in the same manner), form a chain of hills; — and the linear island of
S. Mary, which was upraised thrice the height of the neighbouring
country, seems to be undergoing this process. I believe that the solid axis of a mountain differs in its manner of formation from a volcanic hill only in the molten stone having been repeatedly injected,
instead of having been repeatedly ejected. Moreover, I believe that
it is impossible to explain the structure of great mountain-chains,
such as that of the Cordillera, where the strata, capping the
injected axis of <span class="tooltip">plutonic<span class="tooltiptext">relating to or denoting igneous rock formed by solidification at considerable depth beneath the earth's surface.</span></span> rock, have been thrown on their edges along
several parallel and neighbouring lines of elevation, except on this view of the rock of the axis having been repeatedly injected, after intervals sufficiently long to allow the upper parts or wedges to cool and become solid; — for if the strata had been thrown into their present highly inclined, vertical, and even inverted positions, by a single blow, the very bowels of the earth would have gushed out;
and instead of beholding abrupt mountain-axes of rock solidified under great pressure, deluges of lava would have flowed out at innumerable points on every line of elevation.
