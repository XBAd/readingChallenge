      <h2>OF AGRICULTURE</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he first wish of Virgil</span> (as you will find anon by his verses) was to be a good philosopher, the second, a good husband-man: and God (whom he seem'd to understand better than
most of the most learned heathens) dealt with him just as he did
with Solomon; because he prayed for wisdom in the first place, he
added all things else, which were subordinately to be desir'd. He
made him one of the best philosophers and the best husbandmen;
and, to adorn and communicate both those faculties, the best poet.
He made him, besides all this, a rich man, and a man who desired
to be no richer -
        <blockquote>
          "O fortunatus nimium, et bona qui sua novit!"
        </blockquote>

        To be a husbandman, is but a retreat from the city; to be a philosopher,
from the world; or rather, a retreat from the world, as it is man's, into the world, as it is God's.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, since nature denies to most men the capacity or appetite, and
fortune allows but to a very few the opportunities or possibility of applying themselves wholly to philosophy, the best mixture of humane affairs that we can make, are the employments of a country life. It is, as Columella calls it, "Res sine dubitatione proxima,
et quasi consanguinea sapientiae," the nearest neighbour, or rather next in kindred, to philosophy. Varro says, the principles of it are the same which Ennius made to be the principles of all nature,
Earth, Water, Air, and the Sun. It does certainly comprehend more
parts of philosophy, than any one profession, art, or science, in the world besides: and therefore Cicero says, the pleasures of a husbandman,
"mihi ad sapientis vitam proxime videntur accedere," come
very nigh to those of a philosopher. There is no other sort of life that affords so many branches of praise to a panegyrist: the utility of
it, to a man's self; the usefulness, or rather necessity, of it to all the rest of mankind; the innocence, the pleasure, the antiquity, the
dignity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The utility (I mean plainly the lucre of it) is not so great, now
in our nation, as arises from merchandise and the trading of the
city, from whence many of the best estates and chief honours of the kingdom are derived: we have no men now fetcht from the plow to be made lords, as they were in Rome to be made consuls and dictators; the reason of which I conceive to be from an evil custom, now grown as strong among us as if it were a law, which is, that no men put their children to be bred up apprentices in agriculture,
as in other trades, but such who are so poor, that, when
they come to be men, they have not wherewithal to set up in it, and
so can only farm some small parcel of ground, the rent of which
devours all but the bare subsistence of the tenant: whilst they who
are proprietors of the land are either too proud, or, for want of
that kind of education, too ignorant, to improve their estates, though
the means of doing it be as easie and certain in this, as in any other
track of commerce. If there were always two or three thousand
youths, for seven or eight years, bound to this profession, that they
might learn the whole art of it, and afterwards be enabled to be
masters in it, by a moderate stock, I cannot doubt but that we should
see as many aldermen's estates made in the country, as now we do
out of all kind of merchandizing in the city. There are as many
ways to be rich, and, which is better, there is no possibility to be
poor, without such negligence as can neither have excuse nor pity; for a little ground will, without question, feed a little family, and
the superfluities of life (which are now in some cases by custom
made almost necessary) must be supplyed out of the superabundance
of art and industry, or contemned by as great a degree of philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the necessity of this art, it is evident enough, since this can
live without all others, and no one other without this. This is like speech, without which the society of men cannot be preserved; the
others, like figures and tropes of speech, which serve only to adorn it. Many nations have lived, and some do still, without any art but this: not so elegantly, I confess, but still they live; and almost all the other arts, which are here practised, are beholding to this for most of their
materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        The innocence of this life is the next thing for which I commend
it; and if husbandmen preserve not that, they are much to blame,
for no men are so free from the temptations of iniquity. They live by what they can get by industry from the earth; and others, by
what they can catch by craft from men. They live upon an estate given them by their mother; and others, upon an estate cheated
from their brethren. They live, like sheep and kine, by the allowances of nature; and others, like wolves and foxes, by the acquisitions of rapine. And, I hope, I may affirm (without any offence to the
great) that sheep and kine are very useful, and that wolves and
foxes are pernicious creatures. They are, without dispute, of all men, the most quiet and least apt to be inflamed to the disturbance
of the commonwealth: their manner of life inclines them, and
interest binds them, to love peace: in our late mad and miserable
civil wars, all other trades, even to the meanest, set forth whole
troops, and raised up some great commanders, who became famous
and mighty for the mischiefs they had done: but I do not remember
the name of any one husbandman, who had so considerable a share
in the twenty years' ruine of his country, as to deserve the curses of
his countrymen.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if great delights be joyn'd with so much innocence, I think
it is ill done of men not to take them here, where they are so tame,
and ready at hand, rather than hunt for them in courts and cities, where they are so wild, and the chase so troublesome and dangerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are here among the vast and noble scenes of nature; we are
there among the pitiful shifts of policy: we walk here in the light
and open ways of the divine bounty; we grope there in the dark
and confused labyrinths of humane' malice: our senses are here
feasted with the clear and genuine taste of their objects, which are
all sophisticated there, and for the most part overwhelmed with
their contraries. Here, pleasure looks (methinks) like a beautiful,
constant, and modest wife; it is there an impudent, fickle, and
painted harlot. Here, is harmless and cheap plenty; there, guilty
and expenceful luxury.
      </p>

      <p>
        I shall only instance in one delight more, the most natural and best-natured of all others, a perpetual companion of the husbandman;
and that is, the satisfaction of looking round about him, and seeing
nothing but the effects and improvements of his own art and diligence; to be always gathering of some fruits of it, and at the same
time to behold others ripening, and others budding: to see all his
fields and gardens covered with the beauteous creatures of his own
industry; and to see, like God, that all his works are good: -
        <blockquote>
          - Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Orcades; ipsi Agricolae tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          On his heart-string a secret joy does strike.
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        The antiquity of his art is certainly not be contested by any other. The three first men in the world, were a gardener, a plowman, and
a grazier; and if any man object, that the second of these was a murtherer, I desire he would consider, that as soon as he was so, he
quitted our profession, and turn'd builder. It is for this reason, I suppose, that Ecclesiasticus forbids us to hate husbandry; 'because
(says he) the Most High has created it.' We were all born to this
art, and taught by nature to nourish our bodies by the same earth out of which they were made, and to which they must return, and
pay at last for their sustenance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behold the original and primitive nobility of all those great persons, who are too proud now, not only to till the ground, but
almost to tread upon it. We may talk what we please of lillies, and
lions rampant, and spread-eagles, in fields d'or or d'argent; but, if heraldry were guided by reason, a plough in a field arable would
be the most noble and antient arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        All these considerations make me fall into the wonder and complaint
of Columella, how it should come to pass that all arts or
sciences (for the dispute, which is an art, and which a science, does not belong to the curiosity of us husbandmen) metaphysick, physick,
morality, mathematicks, logick, rhetorick, &c. which are all, I grant,
good and useful faculties, (except only metaphysick which I do not know whether it be anything or no;) but even vaulting, fencing,
dancing, attiring, cookery, carving, and such like vanities, should all have publick schools and masters, and yet that we should never
see or hear of any man, who took upon him the profession of teaching this so pleasant, so virtuous, so profitable, so honourable, so
necessary art.
      </p>

      <p>
        A man would think, when he's in serious humour, that it were
but a vain, irrational, and ridiculous thing for a great company of men and women to run up and down in a room together, in a hundred several postures and figures, to no purpose, and with no
design; and therefore dancing was invented first, and only practised
antiently, in the ceremonies of the heathen religion, which consisted
all in mummery and madness; the latter being the chief glory of the worship, and accounted divine inspiration: this, I say, a severe man would think; though I dare not determine so far against so customary a part, now, of good-breeding. And yet, who is there among our gentry, that does not entertain a dancing-master for his children, as soon as they are able to walk? But did ever any father provide a tutor for his son, to instruct him betimes in the nature and improvements of that land which he intended to leave him?
That is at least a superfluity, and this a defect, in our manner of education; and therefore I could wish (but cannot in these times
much hope to see it) that one colledge in each university were erected,
and appropriated to this study, as well as there are to medicine and
the civil law: there would be no need of making a body of scholars and fellows with certain endowments, as in other colledges; it would
suffice, if, after the manner of halls in Oxford, there were only four
professors constituted (for it would be too much work for only one
master, or principal, as they call him there) to teach these four parts of it: First, Aration, and all things relating to it. Secondly, Pasturage.
Thirdly, Gardens, Orchards, Vineyards, and Woods. Fourthly, all parts of Rural Oeconomy, which would contain the government of
Bees, Swine, Poultry, Decoys, Ponds, &c. and all that which Varro
calls villaticas pastiones, together with the sports of the field (which
ought to be looked upon not only as pleasures, but as parts of housekeeping),
and the domestical conservation and uses of all that is brought in by industry abroad. The business of these professors
should not be, as is commonly practised in other arts, only to read pompous and superficial lectures, out of Virgil's Georgicks, Pliny,
Varro, or Columella; but to instruct their pupils in the whole
method and course of this study, which might be run through perhaps, with diligence, in a year or two: and the continual succession of scholars, upon a moderate taxation for their diet, lodging and
learning, would be a sufficient constant revenue for maintenance of the house and the professors, who should be men not chosen for the
ostentation of critical literature, but for solid and experimental knowledge
of the things they teach; such men, so industrious and publickspirited,
as I conceive Mr. Hartlib to be, if the gentleman be yet alive: but it is needless to speak further of my thoughts of this design, unless
the present disposition of the age allowed more probability of bringing it into execution. What I have further to say of the country
life, shall be borrowed from the poets, who were always the most
faithful and affectionate friends to it. Poetry was born among the
shepherds.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine Musas <br>
        Ducit, et immemores non sinit esse sui.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The Muses still love their own native place; <br>
        'T has secret charms, which nothing can deface.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The truth is, no other place is proper for their work; one might
as well undertake to dance in a crowd, as to make good verses in the midst of noise and tumult.

      <blockquote>
        As well might corn, as verse, in cities grow; <br>
        In vain the thankless glebe we plow and sow; <br>
        Against th' unnatural soil in vain we strive; <br>
        'Tis not a ground, in which these plants will thrive.
      </blockquote>

        It will bear nothing but the nettles and thorns of satyre, which grow
most naturally in the worst earth; and therefore almost all poets,
except those who were not able to eat bread without the bounty of great men, that is, without what they could get by flattering of them,
have not only withdrawn themselves from the vices and vanities of the grand world,

        <blockquote>
          - pariter vitiisque jocisque <br>
          Altius humanis exeruere caput,
        </blockquote>

        into the innocent happiness of a retired life; but have commended
and adorned nothing so much by their ever-living poems. Hesiod was the first or second poet in the world that remains yet extant (if Homer, as some think, preceded him, but I rather beheve they were
contemporaries); and he is the first writer too of the art of husbandry:
"and he has contributed (says Columella) not a little to our
profession;" I suppose, he means not a little honour, for the matter of
his instructions is not very important: his great antiquity is visible through the gravity and simplicity of his stile. The most acute of
all his sayings concerns our purpose very much, and is couched in the reverend obscurity of an oracle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The half is more than the whole. The occasion
of the speech is this: his brother Perses had, by corrupting some great men (great bribe-eaters he calls them), gotten
from him the half of his estate. It is no matter (says he); they have
not done me so much prejudice, as they imagine.

        <blockquote>
          Unhappy they, to whom God ha'n't reveal'd, <br>
          By a strong light which must their sense controul, <br>
          That half a great estate's more than the whole. <br>
          Unhappy, from whom still conceal'd does lye, <br>
          Of roots and herbs, the wholesom luxury.
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        This I conceive to be honest Hesiod's meaning. From Homer, we
must not expect much concerning our affairs. He was blind, and
could neither work in the country nor enjoy the pleasures of it; his
helpless poverty was likeliest to be sustained in the richest places;
he was to delight the Grecians with fine tales of the wars and adventures of their ancestors; his subject removed him from all commerce
with us, and yet, methinks, he made a shift to shew his goodwill
a little. For, though he could do us no honour in the person
of his hero Ulysses (much less of Achilles), because his whole time was consumed in wars and voyages; yet he makes his father Laertes
a gardener all that while, and seeking his consolation for the absence
of his son in the pleasure of planting, and even dunging his own grounds. Ye see, he did not contemn us peasants; nay, so far was
he from that insolence, that he always stiles Eumaeus, who kept the hogs, with wonderful respect, the divine swine herd; he
could ha' done no more for Menelaus or Agamemnon. And Theocritus
(a very antient poet, but he was one of our own tribe, for he
wrote nothing but pastorals) gave the same epithete to an husbandman. The divine husbandman replyed to Hercules. These were civil Greeks, and
who understood the dignity of our calling!
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the Romans we have, in the first place, our truly divine
Virgil, who, though, by the favour of Maecenas and Augustus, he
might have been one of the chief men of Rome, yet chose rather to employ much of his time in the exercise, and much of his immortal
wit in the praise and instructions, of a rustique life; who, though he
had written, before, whole books of pastorals and georgics, could not abstain, in his great and imperial poem, from describing Evander, one of his best princes, as living just after the homely manner of an
ordinary countryman. He seats him in a throne of maple, and lays
him but upon a bear's skin; the kine and oxen are lowing in his court-yard; the birds under the eves of his window call him up in the morning, and when he goes abroad, only two dogs go along with
him for his guard: at last, when he brings Aeneas into his royal
cottage, he makes him say this memorable complement, greater
than even yet was spoken at the Escurial, the Louvre, or our Whitehal:

        <blockquote>
          - Haec (inquit) limina victor <br>
          Alcides subiit, haec illum regia cepit: <br>
          Aude, hospes, contemnere opes: et te quoque dignum <br>
          Finge Deo, rebusque veni non asper egenis.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          This humble roof, this rustick court, (said he) <br>
          Receiv'd Alcides, crown'd with victorie: <br>
          Scorn not, great guest, the steps where he has trod; <br>
          But contemn wealth, and imitate a God.
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        The next man, whom we are much obliged to, both for his doctrine and example, is the next best poet in the world to Virgil, his dear friend Horace; who, when Augustus had desired Maecenas to perswade him to come and live domestically and at the same
table with him, and to be secretary of state of the whole world under
him, or rather jointly with him, for he says, "ut nos in epistolis
scribendis adjuvet," could not be tempted to forsake his Sabin, or
Tiburtin mannor, for so rich and so glorious a trouble. There was
never, I think, such an example as this in the world, that he should
have so much moderation and courage as to refuse an offer of such
greatness, and the emperor so much generosity and good-nature as not to be at all offended with his refusal, but to retain still the same
kindness, and express it often to him in most friendly and familiar
letters, part of which are still extant. If I should produce all the
passages of this excellent author upon the several subjects which I
treat of in this book, I must be obliged to translate half his works;
of which I may say more truly than, in my opinion, he did of Homer.

        <blockquote>
          Qui, quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non, <br>
          Planius et melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit.
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        I shall content myself upon this particular theme with three only, one out of his Odes, the other out of his Satires, the third out of
his Epistles; and shall forbear to collect the suffrages of all other
poets, which may be found scattered up and down through all their writings, and especially in Martial's. But I must not omit to make
some excuse for the bold-undertaking of my own unskilful pencil
upon the beauties of a face that has been drawn before by so many
great masters; especially, that I should dare to do it in Latine verses, (though of another kind), and have the confidence to translate them.
I can only say that I love the matter, and that ought to cover many
faults; and that I run not to contend with those before me, but follow
to applaud them.
