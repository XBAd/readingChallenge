          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey" target="_blank">The Odyssey</a>
           is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer.
          It is, in part, a sequel to <em>the Iliad</em>, the other Homeric epic.
          The Odyssey is fundamental to the modern Western canon;
          it is the second-oldest extant work of Western literature,
          while the Iliad is the oldest. Scholars believe the Odyssey was
          composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia,
          the Greek coastal region of Anatolia. The poem mainly focuses on the
          Greek hero Odysseus (known as Ulysses in Roman myths), king of Ithaca,
          and his journey home after the fall of Troy. It takes Odysseus ten
          years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War.

        'Soon we came to the cave, but we found him not within; he was shepherding his fat flocks in the pastures. So we went into the
cave, and gazed on all that was therein. The baskets were well laden with cheeses, and the folds were thronged with lambs and
kids; each kind was penned by itself, the firstlings apart, and the summer lambs apart, apart too the younglings of the flock. Now
all the vessels swam with whey, the milk-pails and the bowls, the well-wrought vessels whereinto he milked. My company then spake
and besought me first of all to take of the cheeses and to return, and
afterwards to make haste and drive off the kids and lambs to the
swift ships from out the pens, and to sail over the salt sea water. Howbeit I hearkened not (and far better would it have been), but
waited to see the giant himself, and whether he would give me
gifts as a stranger's due. Yet was not his coming to be with joy
to my company.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Then we kindled a fire, and made burnt-offering, and ourselves likewise took of the cheeses, and did eat, and sat waiting for him
within till he came back, shepherding his flocks. And he bore a grievous weight of dry wood, against supper time. This log he
cast down with a din inside the cave, and in fear we fled to the
secret place of the rock. As for him, he drave his fat flocks into the wide cavern, even all that he was wont to milk; but the males both
of the sheep and of the goats he left without in the deep yard. Thereafter
he lifted a huge doorstone and weighty, and set it in the mouth
of the cave, such an one as two and twenty good four-wheeled wains
could not raise from the ground, so mighty a sheer rock did he set against the doorway. Then he sat down and milked the ewes and
bleating goats, all orderly, and beneath each ewe he placed her
young. And <span class="tooltip">anon<span class="tooltiptext">soon; shortly.</span></span> he curdled one half of the white milk, and
massed it together, and stored it in wicker-baskets, and the other half he let stand in pails, that he might have it to take and drink against
supper time. Now when he had done all his work busily, then he
kindled the fire anew, and espied us, and made question:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Strangers, who are ye? Whence sail ye over the wet ways? On
some trading enterprise or at adventure do ye rove, even as sea-robbers over the brine, for at hazard of their own lives they wander,
bringing bale to alien men."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake he, but as for us our heart within us was broken for
terror of the deep voice and his own monstrous shape; yet despite
all I answered and spake unto him, saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Lo, we are Achaeans, driven wandering from Troy, by all manner of winds over the great gulf of the sea; seeking our homes we fare, but another path have we come, by other ways: even such,
methinks, was the will and the counsel of Zeus. And we avow us
to be the men of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose fame is even now the mightiest under heaven, so great a city did he sack, and
destroyed many people; but as for us we have lighted here, and come to these thy knees, if perchance thou wilt give us a stranger's
gift, or make any present, as is the due of strangers. Nay, lord, have
regard to the gods, for we are thy suppliants; and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and sojourners, Zeus, the god of the stranger,
who fareth in the company of reverend strangers."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and anon he answered out of his pitiless heart: "Thou
art witless, my stranger, or thou hast come from afar, who biddest
me either to fear or shun the gods. For the Cyclopes pay no heed to Zeus, lord of the <span class="tooltip">aegis<span class="tooltiptext">(in classical art and mythology) an attribute of Zeus and Athena (or their Roman counterparts Jupiter and Minerva) usually represented as a goatskin shield.</span></span>, nor to the blessed gods, for verily we are
better men than they. Nor would I, to shun the <span class="tooltip">enmity<span class="tooltiptext">the state or feeling of being actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.</span></span> of Zeus, spare either thee or thy company, unless my spirit bade me. But
tell me where thou didst stay thy well-wrought ship on thy coming?
Was it perchance at the far end of the island, or hard by, that I may know?"
      </p>

      <p>
        'So he spake, tempting me, but he cheated me not, who knew
full much, and I answered him again with words of <span class="tooltip">guile<span class="tooltiptext">sly or cunning intelligence.</span></span>:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"As for my ship, Poseidon, the shaker of the earth, brake it to
pieces, for he cast it upon the rocks at the border of your country,
and brought it nigh the headland, and a wind bare it thither from
the sea. But I with these my men escaped from utter doom."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and out of his pitiless heart he answered me not a word, but sprang up, and laid his hands upon my fellows, and
clutching two together dashed them, as they had been whelps, to the earth, and the brain flowed forth upon the ground, and the earth was wet. Then cut he them up piecemeal, and made ready his supper. So he ate even as a mountain-bred lion, and ceased not,
devouring entrails and flesh and bones with their marrow. And we
wept and raised our hands to Zeus, beholding the cruel deeds; and we were at our wits' end. And after the Cyclops had filled his huge
maw with human flesh and the milk he drank thereafter, he lay
within the cave, stretched out among his sheep.
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I took counsel in my great heart, whether I should draw near, and pluck my sharp sword from my thigh, and stab him in the
breast, where the midriff holds the liver, feeling for the place with
my hand. But my second thought withheld me, for so should we
too have perished even there with utter doom. For we should not have prevailed to roll away with our hands from the lofty door
the heavy stone which he set there. So for that time we made
moan, awaiting the bright Dawn.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Now when early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, again he
kindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all orderly, and beneath each ewe set her lamb. Anon when he had done all his work
busily, again he seized yet other two men and made ready his midday
meal. And after the meal, lightly he moved away the great
door-stone, and drave his fat flocks forth from the cave, and afterwards he set it in his place again, as one might set the lid on a
quiver. Then with a loud whoop, the Cyclops turned his fat flocks towards the hills; but I was left devising evil in the deep of my
heart, if in any wise I might avenge me, and Athene grant me
renown.
      </p>

      <p>
        'And this was the counsel that showed best in my sight. There
lay by a sheep-fold a great club of the Cyclops, a club of olive wood,
yet green, which he had cut to carry with him when it should be
seasoned. Now when we saw it we likened it in size to the mast of
a black ship of twenty oars, a wide merchant vessel that traverses the great sea gulf, so huge it was to view in bulk and length.
I stood thereby and cut off from it a portion as it were a fathom's
length, and set it by my fellows, and bade them fine it down, and
they made it even, while I stood by and sharpened it to a point,
and straightway I took it and hardened it in the bright fire. Then
I laid it well away, and hid it beneath the dung, which was scattered
in great heaps in the depths of the cave. And I bade my company
cast lots among them, which of them should risk the adventure
with me, and lift the bar and turn it about in his eye, when sweet
sleep came upon him. And the lot fell upon those four whom I myself would have been fain to choose, and I appointed myself
to be the fifth among them. In the evening he came shepherding his
flocks of goodly fleece, and presently he drave his fat flocks into the cave each and all, nor left he any without in the deep courtyard,
whether through some foreboding, or perchance that the god so bade
him do. Thereafter he lifted the huge door-stone and set it in the mouth of the cave, and sitting down he milked the ewes and
bleating goats, all orderly, and beneath each ewe he placed her
young. Now when he had done all his work busily, again he seized
yet other two and made ready his supper. Then I stood by the Cyclops and spake to him, holding in my hands an ivy bowl of the dark wine:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Cyclops, take and drink wine after thy feast of man's meat,
that thou mayest know what manner of drink this was that our
ship held. And lo, I was bringing it thee as a drink offering, if haply thou mayest take pity and send me on my way home, but
thy mad rage is past all sufferance. O hard of heart, how may another of the many men there be come ever to thee again, seeing
that thy deeds have been lawless?"
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and he took the cup and drank it off, and found great
delight in drinking the sweet draught, and asked me for it yet a second time:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Give it me again of thy grace, and tell me thy name straightway,
that I may give thee a stranger's gift, wherein thou mayest be
glad. Yea for the earth, the grain-giver, bears for the Cyclopes the mighty clusters of the juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives
them increase, but this is a rill of very nectar and ambrosia."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So he spake, and again I handed him the dark wine. Thrice
I bare and gave it him, and thrice in his folly he drank it to the <span class="tooltip">lees<span class="tooltiptext">the sediment of wine in the barrel.</span></span>. Now when the wine had got about the wits of the Cyclops, then
did I speak to him with soft words:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Cyclops, thou askest me my renowned name, and I will declare
it unto thee, and do thou grant me a stranger's gift, as thou didst promise. Noman is my name, and Noman they call me, my father and my mother and all my fellows."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and straightway he answered me out of his pitiless heart:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Noman will I eat last in the number of his fellows, and the others before him: that shall be thy gift."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Therewith he sank backwards and fell with face upturned, and
there he lay with his great neck bent round, and sleep, that conquers all men, overcame him. And the wine and the fragments of men's flesh issued forth from his mouth, and he vomited, being
heavy with wine. Then I thrust in that stake under the deep ashes,
until it should grow hot, and I spake to my companions comfortable
words, lest any should hang back from me in fear. But when that bar of olive wood was just about to catch fire in the flame, green
though it was, and began to glow terribly, even then I came nigh,
and drew it from the coals, and my fellows gathered about me, and some god breathed great courage into us. For their part they seized the bar of olive wood, that was sharpened at the point, and thrust
it into his eye, while I from my place aloft turned it about, as when
a man bores a ship's beam with a drill while his fellows below spin
it with a strap, which they hold at either end, and the auger runs round continually. Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand
and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the
heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and
brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame. And as when a smith dips an axe or adze in chill water with a great hissing, when he would temper it —
for hereby anon comes the strength of iron — even so did his eye hiss round the stake of olive. And he raised a great and terrible cry, that the rock rang around, and we fled away in fear, while he plucked
forth from his eye the brand bedabbled in much blood. Then maddened
with pain he cast it from him with his hands, and called with a loud voice on the Cyclopes, who dwelt about him in the caves along the windy heights. And they heard the cry and flocked
together from every side, and gathering round the cave asked him
what ailed him:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"What hath so distressed thee, Polyphemus, that thou criest thus
aloud through the immortal night, and makest us sleepless? Surely no mortal driveth off thy flocks against thy will: surely none slayeth
thyself by force or craft?"
      </p>

      <p>
        'And the strong Polyphemus spake to them again from out the
cave: "My friends, Noman is slaying me by guile, nor at all by
force."
      </p>

      <p>
        'And they answered and spake winged words: "If then no man
is violently handling thee in thy solitude, it can in no wise be that thou shouldest escape the sickness sent by mighty Zeus. Nay, pray
thou to thy father, the lord Poseidon."
      </p>

      <p>
        'On this wise they spake and departed; and my heart within me
laughed to see how my name and cunning counsel had beguiled
them. But the Cyclops, groaning and travailing in pain, groped
with his hands, and lifted away the stone from the door of the
cave, and himself sat in the entry, with arms outstretched to catch,
if he might, any one that was going forth with his sheep, so witless,
methinks, did he hope to find me. But I advised me how all might
be for the very best, if perchance I might find a way of escape from
death for my companions and myself, and I wove all manner of
craft and counsel, as a man will for his life, seeing that great mischief
was nigh. And this was the counsel that showed best in my sight. The rams of the flock were well nurtured and thick of fleece, great and goodly, with wool dark as the violet. Quietly I lashed them together with twisted withies, whereon the Cyclops slept, that lawless monster. Three together I took: now the middle one of the three would bear each a man, but the other twain went on either
side, saving my fellows. Thus every three sheep bare their man.
But as for me I laid hold of the back of a young ram who was far the best and the goodliest of all the flock, and curled beneath his shaggy belly there I lay, and so clung face upward, grasping the wondrous fleece with a steadfast heart. So for that time making moan we awaited the bright Dawn.
      </p>

      <p>
        'So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then did
the rams of the flock hasten forth to pasture, but the ewes bleated unmilked about the pens, for their udders were swollen to bursting.
Then their lord, sore stricken with pain, felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood up before him, and guessed not in his folly
how that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his thick-fleeced
flocks. Last of all the sheep came forth the ram, cumbered with his wool and the weight of me and my cunning. And the strong Polyphemus
laid his hands on him and spake to him saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Dear ram, wherefore, I pray thee, art thou the last of all the
flocks to go forth from the cave, who of old wast not wont to lag
behind the sheep, but wert ever the foremost to pluck the tender
blossom of the pasture, faring with long strides, and wert still the
first to come to the streams of the rivers, and first did long to return
to the homestead in the evening? But now art thou the very last. Surely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy lord, which an evil man blinded, with his accursed fellows, when he had subdued my
wits with wine, even Noman, whom I say hath not yet escaped
destruction. Ah, if thou couldst feel as I, and be endued with speech,
to tell me where he shifts about to shun my wrath; then should he
be smitten, and his brains be dashed against the floor here and
there about the cave, and my heart be lightened of the sorrows which
Noman, nothing worth, hath brought me!"
      </p>

      <p>
        'Therewith he sent the ram forth from him, and when we had
gone but a little way from the cave and from the yard, first I loosed myself from under the ram and then I set my fellows free. And swiftly we drave on those stiff-shanked sheep, so rich in fat, and
often turned to look about, till we came to the ship. And a glad
sight to our fellows were we that had fled from death, but the others they would have bemoaned with tears; howbeit I suffered it not,
but with frowning brows forbade each man to weep. Rather I bade
them to cast on board the many sheep with goodly fleece, and to
sail over the salt sea water. So they embarked forthwith, and sate upon the benches, and sitting orderly smote the grey sea water with
their oars. But when I had not gone so far, but that a man's shout
might be heard, then I spoke unto the Cyclops taunting him:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Cyclops, so thou wert not to eat the company of a weakling by
main might in thy hollow cave! Thine evil deeds were very sure to find thee out, thou cruel man, who hadst no shame to eat thy guests
within thy gates, wherefore Zeus hath requited thee, and the other
gods."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and he was mightily angered at heart, and he brake
off the peak of a great hill and threw it at us, and it fell in front of
the dark-prowed ship.' And the sea heaved beneath the fall of the
rock, and the backward flow of the wave bare the ship quickly to the dry land, with the wash from the deep sea, and drave it to the
shore. Then I caught up a long pole in my hands, and thrust the
ship from off the land, and roused my company, and with a motion
of the head bade them dash in with their oars, that so we might
escape our evil plight. So they bent to their oars and rowed on. But
when we had now made twice the distance over the brine, I would
fain have spoken to the Cyclops, but my company stayed me on
every side with soft words, saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Foolhardy that thou art, why wouldst thou rouse a wild man
to wrath, who even now hath cast so mighty a throw towards the deep and brought our ship back to land, yea and we thought that we had perished even there? If he had heard any of us utter sound
or speech he would have crushed our heads and our ship timbers
with a cast of a rugged stone, so mightily he hurls."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake they, but they prevailed not on my lordly spirit, and I answered him again from out an angry heart:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Cyclops, if any one of mortal men shall ask thee of the unsightly
blinding of thine eye, say that it was Odysseus that blinded
it, the waster of cities, son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and with a moan he answered me, saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Lo now, in very truth the ancient oracles have come upon me. There lived here a <span class="tooltip">soothsayer<span class="tooltiptext">a person supposed to be able to foresee the future.</span></span>, a noble man and a mighty, Telemus,
son of Eurymus, who surpassed all men in soothsaying, and waxed
old as a seer among the Cyclopes. He told me that all these things
should come to pass in the aftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight
at the hand of Odysseus. But I ever looked for some tall and
goodly man to come hither, clad in great might, but behold now one
that is a dwarf, a man of no worth and a weakling, hath blinded
me of my eye after subduing me with wine. Nay come hither,
Odysseus, that I may set by thee a stranger's cheer, and speed thy
parting hence, that so the Earth-shaker may vouchsafe it thee, for
his son am I, and he avows him for my father. And he himself will heal me, if it be his will; and none other of the blessed gods or of mortal men."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Even so he spake, but I answered him, and said: "Would god that
I were as sure to rob thee of soul and life, and send thee within the house of Hades, as I am that not even the Earth-shaker will heal thine eye!"
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and then he prayed to the lord Poseidon stretching forth his hands to the starry heaven: "Hear me, Poseidon, girdler
of the earth, god of the dark hair, if indeed I be thine, and thou
avowest thee my sire, — grant that he may never come to his home,
even Odysseus, waster of cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling
is in Ithaca; yet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto
his well-builded house, and his own country, late may he come in
evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship of strangers,
and find sorrows in his house."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard him.
And once again he lifted a stone, far greater than the first, and
with one swing he hurled it, and he put forth a measureless strength,
and cast it but a little space behind the dark-prowed ship, and all but struck the end of the rudder. And the sea heaved beneath
the fall of the rock, but the wave bare on the ship and drave it to the
further shore.
      </p>

      <p>
        'But when we had now reached that island, where all our other
decked ships abode together, and our company were gathered sorrowing, expecting us evermore, on our coming thither we ran our
ship ashore upon the sand, and ourselves too stept forth upon the
sea beach. Next we took forth the sheep of the Cyclops from out the
hollow ship, and divided them, that none through me might go
lacking his proper share. But the ram for me alone my goodlygreaved
company chose out, in the dividing of the sheep, and on
the shore I offered him up to Zeus, even to the son of Cronos, who
dwells in the dark clouds, and is lord of all, and I burnt the slices of the thighs. But he heeded not the sacrifice, but was devising how
my decked ships and my dear company might perish utterly. Thus
for that time we sat the livelong day, until the going down of the
sun, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. And when the sun had sunk and darkness had come on, then we laid us to rest upon
the sea beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,
I called to my company, and commanded them that they should
themselves climb the ship and loose the hawsers. So they soon embarked and sat upon the benches, and sitting orderly smote the grey sea water with their oars.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men
saved from death, albeit we had lost our dear companions.
