        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" target="_blank"><em>Daniel Defoe</em></a>
           (c. 1660 – 24 April 1731), born Daniel Foe, was an English trader, writer, journalist, pamphleteer and spy.
           He is most famous for his novel <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, which is second only
           to the Bible in its number of translations. He has been seen as one
           of the earliest proponents of the English novel, and helped to popularise
           the form in Britain with others such as Aphra Behn and Samuel Richardson.
           Defoe wrote many political tracts and often was in trouble with the authorities,
           including a spell in prison. Intellectuals and political leaders paid
           attention to his fresh ideas and sometimes consulted with him.
           Defoe was a prolific and versatile writer, producing more than three
           hundred works—books, pamphlets, and journals—on diverse topics,
           including politics, crime, religion, marriage, psychology, and
           the supernatural. He was also a pioneer of business journalism
           and economic journalism.

      <h2>THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smallcaps">have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs
in the world</span>, considering us as a civilized and a Christian
country, that we deny the advantages of learning to women. We reproach the sex every day with folly and <span class="tooltip">impertinence<span class="tooltiptext">lack of respect; rudeness.</span></span>; while I am confident, had they the advantages of education equal to us, they
would be guilty of less than ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        One would wonder, indeed, how it should happen that women
are conversible at all; since they are only beholden to natural parts, for all their knowledge. Their youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sew or make <span class="tooltip">baubles<span class="tooltiptext">a small, showy trinket or decoration.</span></span>. They are taught to read, indeed, and
perhaps to write their names, or so; and that is the height of a woman's education. And I would but ask any who slight the sex for
their understanding, what is a man (a gentleman, I mean) good for, that is taught no more? I need not give instances, or examine the character of a gentleman, with a good estate, or a good family, and
with tolerable parts; and examine what figure he makes for want
of education.
      </p>

      <p>
        The soul is placed in the body like a rough diamond; and must be
polished, or the lustre of it will never appear. And 'tis manifest, that
as the rational soul distinguishes us from brutes; so education carries on the distinction, and makes some less brutish than others. This is too evident to need any demonstration. But why then should women
be denied the benefit of instruction? If knowledge and understanding
had been useless additions to the sex, GOD Almighty would
never have given them capacities; for he made nothing needless. Besides, I would ask such, What they can see in ignorance, that they
should think it a necessary ornament to a woman? or how much
worse is a wise woman than a fool? or what has the woman done
to forfeit the privilege of being taught? Does she plague us with her
pride and impertinence? Why did we not let her learn, that she
might have had more wit? Shall we <span class="tooltip">upbraid<span class="tooltiptext">find fault with (someone); scold.</span></span> women with folly, when 'tis only the error of this inhuman custom, that hindered them
from being made wiser?
      </p>

      <p>
        The capacities of women are supposed to be greater, and their
senses quicker than those of the men; and what they might be
capable of being bred to, is plain from some instances of female wit,
which this age is not without. Which upbraids us with Injustice,
and looks as if we denied women the advantages of education, for
fear they should vie with the men in their improvements. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        [They] should be taught all sorts of breeding suitable both to their genius and quality. And in particular. Music and Dancing; which
it would be cruelty to bar the sex of, because they are their darlings.
But besides this, they should be taught languages, as particularly
French and Italian: and I would venture the injury of giving a woman more tongues than one. They should, as a particular study,
be taught all the graces of speech, and all the necessary air of conversation;
which our common education is so defective in, that I need
not expose it. They should be brought to read books, and especially
history; and so to read as to make them understand the world, and
be able to know and judge of things when they hear of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        To such whose genius would lead them to it, I would deny no
sort of learning; but the chief thing, in general, is to cultivate the understandings of the sex, that they may be capable of all sorts of
conversation; that their parts and judgements being improved, they
may be as profitable in their conversation as they are pleasant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Women, in my observation, have little or no difference in them,
but as they are or are not distinguished by education. Tempers,
indeed, may in some degree influence them, but the main distinguishing part is their Breeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole sex are generally quick and sharp. I believe, I may be
allowed to say, generally so: for you rarely see them lumpish and
heavy, when they are children; as boys will often be. If a woman
be well bred, and taught the proper management of her natural wit; she proves generally very sensible and retentive.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, without partiality, a woman of sense and manners is the
finest and most delicate part of GOD's Creation, the glory of Her
Maker, and the great instance of His singular regard to man. His darling creature: to whom He gave the best gift either GOD could
bestow or man receive. And 'tis the sordidest piece of folly and
ingratitude in the world, to withhold from the sex the due lustre which the advantages of education gives to the natural beauty of
their minds.
      </p>

      <p>
        A woman well bred and well taught, furnished with the additional accomplishments of knowledge and behaviour, is a creature without
comparison. Her society is the emblem of sublimer enjoyments, her
person is angelic, and her conversation heavenly. She is all softness and sweetness, peace, love, wit, and delight. She is every way suitable to the sublimest wish, and the man that has such a one to his portion,
has nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and be thankful.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, Suppose her to be the very same woman, and
rob her of the benefit of education, and it follows -
      </p>

      <p>
        If her temper be good, want of education makes her soft and easy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her wit, for want of teaching, makes her impertinent and talkative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her knowledge, for want of judgement and experience, makes her fanciful and whimsical.
      </p>

      <p>
        If her temper be bad, want of breeding makes her worse; and she grows haughty, insolent, and loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        If she be passionate, want of manners makes her a <span class="tooltip">termagant<span class="tooltiptext">a harsh-tempered or overbearing woman.</span></span> and a scold, which is much at one with Lunatic.
      </p>

      <p>
        If she be proud, want of discretion (which still is breeding) makes her conceited, fantastic, and ridiculous.
      </p>

      <p>
        And from these she degenerates to be turbulent, clamorous, noisy, nasty, the devil! . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        The great distinguishing difference, which is seen in the world
between men and women, is in their education; and this is manifested
by comparing it with the difference between one man or woman, and another.
      </p>

      <p>
        And herein it is that I take upon me to make such a bold assertion,
That all the world are mistaken in their practice about women. For
I cannot think that GOD Almighty ever made them so delicate, so glorious creatures; and furnished them with such charms, so agreeable
and so delightful to mankind; with souls capable of the same
accomplishments with men: and all, to be only Stewards of our
Houses, Cooks, and Slaves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not that I am for exalting the female government in the least:
but, in short, I would have men take women for companions, and
educate them to be fit for it. A woman of sense and breeding will scorn as much to encroach upon the <span class="tooltip">prerogative<span class="tooltiptext">a right or privilege exclusive to a particular individual or class.</span></span> of man, as a man
of sense will scorn to oppress the weakness of the woman. But if the women's souls were refined and improved by teaching, that word
would be lost. To say, the weakness of the sex, as to judgement,
would be nonsense; for ignorance and folly would be no more to be
found among women than men.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember a passage, which I heard from a very fine woman.
She had wit and capacity enough, an extraordinary shape and face,
and a great fortune: but had been cloistered up all her time; and for
fear of being stolen, had not had the liberty of being taught the common necessary knowledge of women's affairs. And when she came to converse in the world, her natural wit made her so sensible of the want of education, that she gave this short reflection on herself:
"I am ashamed to talk with my very maids," says she, "for I don't know when they do right or wrong. I had more need go to school,
than be married."
      </p>

      <p>
        I need not enlarge on the loss the defect of education is to the sex; nor argue the benefit of the contrary practice. 'Tis a thing will be more easily granted than remedied. This chapter is but an Essay at the thing: and I refer the Practice to those Happy Days (if ever they
shall be) when men shall be wise enough to mend it.
