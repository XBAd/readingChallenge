      <h2>The Bridge of Sighs</h2>

      <p>
        ONE more Unfortunate <br>
        Weary of breath<br>
        Rashly importunate,<br>
        Gone to her death!
      </p>

      <p>
        Take her up tenderly,<br>
        Lift her with care;<br>
        Fashion’d so slenderly,<br>
        Young, and so fair!
      </p>

      <p>
        Look at her garments<br>
        Clinging like cerements;<br>
        Whilst the wave constantly<br>
        Drips from her clothing;<br>
        Take her up instantly,<br>
        Loving, not loathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Touch her not scornfully;<br>
        Think of her mournfully,<br>
        Gently and humanly;<br>
        Not of the stains of her—<br>
        All that remains of her<br>
        Now is pure womanly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Make no deep scrutiny<br>
        Into her mutiny<br>
        Rash and undutiful:<br>
        Past all dishonour,<br>
        Death has left on her<br>
        Only the beautiful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, for all slips of hers,<br>
        One of Eve’s family—<br>
        Wipe those poor lips of hers<br>
        Oozing so clammily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loop up her tresses<br>
        Escaped from the comb,<br>
        Her fair auburn tresses;<br>
        Whilst wonderment guesses<br>
        Where was her home?
      </p>

      <p>
        Who was her father?<br>
        Who was her mother?<br>
        Had she a sister?<br>
        Had she a brother?<br>
        Or was there a dearer one<br>
        Still, and a nearer one<br>
        Yet, than all other?
      </p>

      <p>
        Alas! for the rarity<br>
        Of Christian charity<br>
        Under the sun!<br>
        O! it was pitiful!<br>
        Near a whole city full,<br>
        Home she had none.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sisterly, brotherly,<br>
        Fatherly, motherly<br>
        Feelings had changed:<br>
        Love, by harsh evidence,<br>
        Thrown from its eminence;<br>
        Even God’s providence<br>
        Seeming estranged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where the lamps quiver<br>
        So far in the river,<br>
        With many a light<br>
        From window and casement,<br>
        From garret to basement,<br>
        She stood, with amazement,<br>
        Houseless by night.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bleak wind of March<br>
        Made her tremble and shiver;<br>
        But not the dark arch,<br>
        Or the black flowing river:
      </p>

      <p>
        Mad from life’s history,<br>
        Glad to death’s mystery<br>
        Swift to be hurl’d—<br>
        Anywhere, anywhere<br>
        Out of the world!
      </p>

      <p>
        In she plunged boldly,<br>
        No matter how coldly<br>
        The rough river ran,<br>
        Over the brink of it,—<br>
        Picture it, think of it,<br>
        Dissolute Man!<br>
        Lave in it, drink of it,<br>
        Then, if you can!
      </p>

      <p>
        Take her up tenderly,<br>
        Lift her with care;<br>
        Fashion’d so slenderly,<br>
        Young, and so fair!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ere her limbs frigidly<br>
        Stiffen too rigidly,<br>
        Decently, kindly,<br>
        Smooth and compose them;<br>
        And her eyes, close them,<br>
        Staring so blindly!
      </p>

      <p>
        Dreadfully staring<br>
        Thro’ muddy impurity,<br>
        As when with the daring<br>
        Last look of despairing<br>
        Fix’d on futurity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perishing gloomily,<br>
        Spurr’d by contumely,<br>
        Cold inhumanity,<br>
        Burning insanity,<br>
        Into her rest.<br>
        —Cross her hands humbly<br>
        As if praying dumbly,<br>
        Over her breast!
      </p>

      <p>
        Owning her weakness,<br>
        Her evil behaviour,<br>
        And leaving, with meekness,<br>
        Her sins to her Saviour.
      </p>

      <h2>The Death Bed</h2>

      <p>
        WE watch’d her breathing thro’ the night,<br>
          Her breathing soft and low,<br>
        As in her breast the wave of life<br>
          Kept heaving to and fro.
      </p>

      <p>
        So silently we seemed to speak,<br>
          So slowly moved about,<br>
        As we had lent her half our powers<br>
          To eke her living out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our very hopes belied our fears,<br>
          Our fears our hopes belied—<br>
        We thought her dying when she slept,<br>
          And sleeping when she died.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when the morn came dim and sad<br>
          And chill with early showers,<br>
        Her quiet eyelids closed—she had<br>
          Another morn than ours.
      </p>

      <h2>Past and Present</h2>

      <p>
        I REMEMBER, I remember<br>
        The house where I was born,<br>
        The little window where the sun<br>
        Came peeping in at morn;<br>
        He never came a wink too soon<br>
        Nor brought too long a day;<br>
        But now, I often wish the night<br>
        Had borne my breath away.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember, I remember<br>
        The roses, red and white,<br>
        The violets, and the lily-cups—<br>
        Those flowers made of light!<br>
        The lilacs where the robin built,<br>
        And where my brother set<br>
        The laburnum on his birthday,—<br>
        The tree is living yet!
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember, I remember<br>
        Where I was used to swing,<br>
        And thought the air must rush as fresh<br>
        To swallows on the wing;<br>
        My spirit flew in feathers then<br>
        That is so heavy now,<br>
        And summer pools could hardly cool<br>
        The fever on my brow.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember, I remember<br>
        The fir-trees dark and high;<br>
        I used to think their slender tops<br>
        Were close against the sky:<br>
        It was a childish ignorance,<br>
        But now ’tis little joy<br>
        To know I’m farther off from Heaven<br>
        Than when I was a boy.
