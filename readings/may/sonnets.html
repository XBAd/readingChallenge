        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare's_sonnets" target="_blank">Shakespeare's sonnets</a>
            are poems that William Shakespeare wrote on a
           variety of themes. When discussing or referring to Shakespeare's sonnets,
           it is almost always a reference to the 154 sonnets that were first
           published all together in a quarto in 1609. Shakespeare’s sonnets
           are considered a continuation of the sonnet tradition that swept
           through the Renaissance from Petrarch in 14th-century Italy and
           was finally introduced in 16th-century England by Thomas Wyatt
           and was given its rhyming meter and division into quatrains by
           Henry Howard. With few exceptions, Shakespeare’s sonnets observe
           the stylistic form of the English sonnet—the rhyme scheme,
           the 14 lines, and the meter. But Shakespeare’s sonnets introduce
           such significant departures of content that they seem to be
           rebelling against well-worn 200-year-old traditions.

      <h2>A Sea Dirge</h2>

      <p>
        FULL fathom five thy father lies: <br>
        Of his bones are coral made;<br>
        Those are pearls that were his eyes:<br>
        Nothing of him that doth fade,<br>
        But doth suffer a sea-change<br>
        Into something rich and strange.<br>
        Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:<br>
        Hark! now I hear them,—<br>
        Ding, dong, bell.
      </p>

      <h2>Eighteenth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        SHALL I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate;<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:<br>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        And often is his gold complexion dimm’d:<br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d.<br>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<br>
        Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade<br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou growest.<br>
          So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see<br>
          So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
      </p>

      <h2>Twenty-ninth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes<br>
        I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
        And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br>
        And look upon myself, and curse my fate;<br>
        Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br>
        Featured like him, like him with friends possest,<br>
        Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,<br>
        With what I most enjoy contented least;<br>
        Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,<br>
        Haply I think on thee—and then my state,<br>
        Like to the lark at break of day arising<br>
        From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;<br>
          For thy sweet love remember’d, such wealth brings<br>
          That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
      </p>

      <h2>Thirtieth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN to the sessions of sweet silent thought<br>
        I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>
        I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>
        And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste;<br>
        Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,<br>
        For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,<br>
        And weep afresh love’s long-since cancell’d woe,<br>
        And moan the expense of many a vanish’d sight.<br>
        Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br>
        And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er<br>
        The sad account of fore-bemoanèd moan,<br>
        Which I new pay as if not paid before:<br>
          But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<br>
          All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
      </p>

      <h2>Thirty-first Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        THY bosom is endearèd with all hearts<br>
        Which I, by lacking, have supposèd dead:<br>
        And there reigns Love, and all Love’s loving parts,<br>
        And all those friends which I thought burièd.<br>
        How many a holy and <span class="tooltip">obsequious<span class="tooltiptext">marked by or exhibiting a fawning attentiveness</span></span> tear<br>
        Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye,<br>
        As interest of the dead!—which now appear<br>
        But things removed that hidden in thee lie.<br>
        Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,<br>
        Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,<br>
        Who all their parts of me to thee did give;<br>
        That due of many now is thine alone:<br>
          Their images I loved I view in thee,<br>
          And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.
      </p>

      <h2>Thirty-second Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        IF thou survive my well-contented day<br>
        When that <span class="tooltip">churl<span class="tooltiptext">an impolite and mean-spirited person; a rude ill-bred person</span></span> Death my bones with dust shall cover,<br>
        And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<br>
        These poor rude lines of thy deceaséd lover;<br>
        Compare them with the bettering of the time,<br>
        And though they be outstripp’d by every pen,<br>
        Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme<br>
        Exceeded by the height of happier men.<br>
        O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought—<br>
        ‘Had my friend’s muse grown with this growing age,<br>
        A dearer birth than this his love had brought,<br>
        To march in ranks of better equipage:<br>
          But since he died, and poets better prove,<br>
          Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love’.
      </p>

      <h2>Thirty-third Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        FULL many a glorious morning have I seen<br>
        Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br>
        Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br>
        Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br>
        <span class="tooltip">Anon<span class="tooltiptext">soon; shortly.</span></span> permit the basest clouds to ride<br>
        With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br>
        And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br>
        Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br>
        Even so my sun one early morn did shine<br>
        With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;<br>
        But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;<br>
        The region-cloud hath mask’d him from me now.<br>
          Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br>
          Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.
      </p>

      <h2>Fifty-fourth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        O HOW much more doth beauty beauteous seem<br>
        By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!<br>
        The Rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br>
        For that sweet odour which doth in it live.<br>
        The <span class="tooltip">Canker-blooms<span class="tooltiptext">the bloom or blossom of the wild rose or dog-rose</span></span> have full as deep a dye<br>
        As the perfumèd tincture of the Roses,<br>
        Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly<br>
        When summer’s breath their maskèd buds discloses;<br>
        But—for their virtue only is their show—<br>
        They live unwoo’d and unrespected fade,<br>
        Die to themselves. Sweet Roses do not so;<br>
        Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made.<br>
          And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<br>
          When that shall fade, my verse distils your truth.
      </p>

      <h2>Fifty-fifth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        NOT marble, nor the gilded monuments<br>
        Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;<br>
        But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br>
        Than unswept stone, besmear’d with sluttish time.<br>
        When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br>
        And broils root out the work of masonry,<br>
        Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn<br>
        The living record of your memory.<br>
        ’Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<br>
        Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<br>
        Even in the eyes of all posterity<br>
        That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br>
          So, till the judgment that yourself arise,<br>
          You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.
      </p>

      <h2>Fifty-seventh Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        BEING your slave, what should I do but tend<br>
        Upon the hours and times of your desire?<br>
        I have no precious time at all to spend<br>
        Nor services to do, till you require:<br>
        Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour<br>
        Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,<br>
        Nor think the bitterness of absence sour<br>
        When you have bid your servant once adieu:<br>
        Nor dare I question with my jealous thought<br>
        Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,<br>
        But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought<br>
        Save, where you are, how happy you make those.<br>
          So true a fool is love, that in your will,<br>
          Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.
      </p>

      <h2>Sixtieth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        LIKE as the waves make towards the pebbled shore<br>
        So do our minutes hasten to their end;<br>
        Each changing place with that which goes before,<br>
        In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br>
        Nativity once in the main of light,<br>
        Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown’d,<br>
        Crooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight,<br>
        And Time, that gave, doth now his gift confound.<br>
        Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,<br>
        And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow;<br>
        Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,<br>
        And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<br>
          And yet, to times in hope, my verse shall stand<br>
          Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
      </p>

      <h2>Sixty-fourth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced<br>
        The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;<br>
        When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,<br>
        And brass eternal, slave to mortal rage;<br>
        When I have seen the hungry ocean gain<br>
        Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,<br>
        And the firm soil win of the watery main,<br>
        Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;<br>
        When I have seen such interchange of state,<br>
        Or state itself confounded to decay,<br>
        Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate—<br>
        That Time will come and take my Love away:<br>
          This thought is as a death, which cannot choose<br>
          But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
      </p>

      <h2>Sixty-fifth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        SINCE brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<br>
        But sad mortality o’ersways their power,<br>
        How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<br>
        Whose action is no stronger than a flower?<br>
        O how shall summer’s honey breath hold out<br>
        Against the wreckful siege of battering days,<br>
        When rocks impregnable are not so stout<br>
        Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?<br>
        O fearful meditation! where, alack!<br>
        Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?<br>
        Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,<br>
        Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?<br>
          O none, unless this miracle have might,<br>
          That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
      </p>

      <h2>Sixty-sixth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        TIRED with all these, for restful death I cry,—<br>
        As, to behold desert a beggar born,<br>
        And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity,<br>
        And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br>
        And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,<br>
        And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br>
        And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,<br>
        And strength by limping sway disabled,<br>
        And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br>
        And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,<br>
        And simple truth miscall’d simplicity,<br>
        And captive Good attending captain Ill:<br>
          Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,<br>
          Save that, to die, I leave my Love alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Seventy-first Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        NO longer mourn for me when I am dead<br>
        Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell<br>
        Give warning to the world, that I am fled<br>
        From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell;<br>
        Nay, if you read this line, remember not<br>
        The hand that writ it; for I love you so,<br>
        That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot<br>
        If thinking on me then should make you woe.<br>
        O, if, I say, you look upon this verse<br>
        When I perhaps compounded am with clay,<br>
        Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,<br>
        But let your love even with my life decay,<br>
          Lest the wise world should look into your moan,<br>
          And mock you with me after I am gone.
      </p>

      <h2>Seventy-third Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        THAT time of year thou may’st in me behold<br>
        When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br>
        Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br>
        Bare ruin’d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang:<br>
        In me thou see’st the twilight of such day<br>
        As after sunset fadeth in the west,<br>
        Which by and by black night doth take away,<br>
        Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest:<br>
        In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,<br>
        That on the ashes of his youth doth lie<br>
        As the deathbed whereon it must expire,<br>
        Consumed with that which it was norish’d by:<br>
          This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,<br>
          To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
      </p>

      <h2>Eighty-seventh Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        FAREWELL! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br>
        And like enough thou know’st thy estimate:<br>
        The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;<br>
        My bonds in thee are all determinate.<br>
        For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<br>
        And for that riches where is my deserving?<br>
        The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br>
        And so my patent back again is swerving.<br>
        Thyself thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,<br>
        Or me, to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking;<br>
        So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<br>
        Comes home again, on better judgment making.<br>
          Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter;<br>
          In sleep, a king; but waking, no such matter.
      </p>

      <h2>Ninetieth Sonnet</h2>

      <p>
        THEN hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;<br>
        Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,<br>
        Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,<br>
        And do not drop in for an after-loss:<br>
        Ah! do not, when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow,<br>
        Come in the rearward of a conquer’d woe;<br>
        Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,<br>
        To linger out a purposed overthrow.<br>
        If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,<br>
        When other petty griefs have done their spite,<br>
        But in the onset come: so shall I taste<br>
        At first the very worst of fortune’s might;<br>
          And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,<br>
          Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
