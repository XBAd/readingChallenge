      <h2>The Twa Dogs</h2>

      <h2>A TALE</h2>

      <p>
        ’TWAS in that place o’ Scotland’s isle, <br>
        That bears the name o’ auld King Coil,<br>
        Upon a bonie day in June,<br>
        When wearin’ thro’ the afternoon,<br>
        Twa dogs, that were na thrang at hame,<br>
        Forgather’d ance upon a time.<br>
          The first I’ll name, they ca’d him Caesar,<br>
        Was keepit for His Honor’s pleasure:<br>
        His hair, his size, his mouth, his lugs,<br>
        Shew’d he was nane o’ Scotland’s dogs;<br>
        But whalpit some place far abroad,<br>
        Whare sailors gang to fish for cod.<br>
          His locked, letter’d, braw brass collar<br>
        Shew’d him the gentleman an’ scholar;<br>
        But though he was o’ high degree,<br>
        The fient a pride, nae pride had he;<br>
        But wad hae spent an hour caressin,<br>
        Ev’n wi’ al tinkler-gipsy’s messin:<br>
        At kirk or market, mill or smiddie,<br>
        Nae tawted tyke, tho’ e’er sae duddie,<br>
        But he wad stan’t, as glad to see him,<br>
        An’ stroan’t on stanes an’ hillocks wi’ him.<br>
          The tither was a ploughman’s collie—<br>
        A rhyming, ranting, raving billie,<br>
        Wha for his friend an’ comrade had him,<br>
        And in freak had Luath ca’d him,<br>
        After some dog in Highland Sang,<br>
        Was made lang syne,—Lord knows how lang.<br>
          He was a gash an’ faithfu’ tyke,<br>
        As ever lap a sheugh or dyke.<br>
        His honest, sonsie, baws’nt face<br>
        Aye gat him friends in ilka place;<br>
        His breast was white, his touzie back<br>
        Weel clad wi’ coat o’ glossy black;<br>
        His gawsie tail, wi’ upward curl,<br>
        Hung owre his hurdie’s wi’ a swirl.<br>
          Nae doubt but they were fain o’ ither,<br>
        And unco pack an’ thick thegither;<br>
        Wi’ social nose whiles snuff’d an’ snowkit;<br>
        Whiles mice an’ moudieworts they howkit;<br>
        Whiles scour’d awa’ in lang excursion,<br>
        An’ worry’d ither in diversion;<br>
        Until wi’ daffin’ weary grown<br>
        Upon a knowe they set them down.<br>
        An’ there began a lang digression.<br>
        About the “lords o’ the creation.”

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        I’ve aften wonder’d, honest Luath,<br>
      What sort o’ life poor dogs like you have;<br>
      An’ when the gentry’s life I saw,<br>
      What way poor bodies liv’d ava.<br>
        Our laird gets in his racked rents,<br>
      His coals, his kane, an’ a’ his stents:<br>
      He rises when he likes himsel’;<br>
      His flunkies answer at the bell;<br>
      He ca’s his coach; he ca’s his horse;<br>
      He draws a bonie silken purse,<br>
      As lang’s my tail, where, thro’ the steeks,<br>
      The yellow letter’d Geordie keeks.<br>
        Frae morn to e’en, it’s nought but toiling<br>
      At baking, roasting, frying, boiling;<br>
      An’ tho’ the gentry first are stechin,<br>
      Yet ev’n the ha’ folk fill their pechan<br>
      Wi’ sauce, ragouts, an’ sic like trashtrie,<br>
      That’s little short o’ downright wastrie.<br>
      Our whipper-in, wee, blasted wonner,<br>
      Poor, worthless elf, it eats a dinner,<br>
      Better than ony tenant-man<br>
      His Honour has in a’ the lan’:<br>
      An’ what poor cot-folk pit their painch in,<br>
      I own it’s past my comprehension.
      </p>

      <h3>LUATH</h3>

      <p>
        Trowth, Cæsar, whiles they’re fash’t eneugh:<br>
      A cottar howkin in a sheugh,<br>
      Wi’ dirty stanes biggin a dyke,<br>
      Baring a quarry, an’ sic like;<br>
      Himsel’, a wife, he thus sustains,<br>
      A smytrie o’ wee duddie weans,<br>
      An’ nought but his han’-daurk, to keep<br>
      Them right an’ tight in thack an’ rape.<br>
        An’ when they meet wi’ sair disasters,<br>
      Like loss o’ health or want o’ masters,<br>
      Ye maist wad think, a wee touch langer,<br>
      An’ they maun starve o’ cauld an’ hunger:<br>
      But how it comes, I never kent yet,<br>
      They’re maistly wonderfu’ contented;<br>
      An’ buirdly chiels, an’ clever hizzies,<br>
      Are bred in sic a way as this is.
      </p>

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        But then to see how ye’re negleckit,<br>
      How huff’d, an’ cuff’d, an’ disrespeckit!<br>
      Lord man, our gentry care as little<br>
      For delvers, ditchers, an’ sic cattle;<br>
      They gang as saucy by poor folk,<br>
      As I wad by a stinkin brock.<br>
        I’ve notic’d, on our laird’s court-day,—<br>
      An’ mony a time my heart’s been wae,—<br>
      Poor tenant bodies, scant o’cash,<br>
      How they maun thole a factor’s snash;<br>
      He’ll stamp an’ threaten, curse an’ swear<br>
      He’ll apprehend them, poind their gear;<br>
      While they maun stan’, wi’ aspect humble,<br>
      An’ hear it a’, an’ fear an’ tremble!<br>
        I see how folk live that hae riches;<br>
      But surely poor-folk maun be wretches!
      </p>

      <h3>LUATH</h3>

      <p>
        They’re no sae wretched’s ane wad think.<br>
      Tho’ constantly on poortith’s brink,<br>
      They’re sae accustom’d wi’ the sight,<br>
      The view o’t gives them little fright.<br>
        Then chance and fortune are sae guided,<br>
      They’re aye in less or mair provided:<br>
      An’ tho’ fatigued wi’ close employment,<br>
      A blink o’ rest’s a sweet enjoyment.<br>
        The dearest comfort o’ their lives,<br>
      Their grushie weans an’ faithfu’ wives;<br>
      The prattling things are just their pride,<br>
      That sweetens a’ their fire-side.<br>
        An’ whiles twalpennie worth o’ nappy<br>
      Can mak the bodies unco happy:<br>
      They lay aside their private cares,<br>
      To mind the Kirk and State affairs;<br>
      They’ll talk o’ patronage an’ priests,<br>
      Wi’ kindling fury i’ their breasts,<br>
      Or tell what new taxation’s comin,<br>
      An’ ferlie at the folk in Lon’on.<br>
        As bleak-fac’d Hallowmass returns,<br>
      They get the jovial, rantin kirns,<br>
      When rural life, of ev’ry station,<br>
      Unite in common recreation;<br>
      Love blinks, Wit slaps, an’ social Mirth<br>
      Forgets there’s Care upo’ the earth.<br>
        That merry day the year begins,<br>
      They bar the door on frosty win’s;<br>
      The nappy reeks wi’ mantling ream,<br>
      An’ sheds a heart-inspiring steam;<br>
      The luntin pipe, an’ sneeshin mill,<br>
      Are handed round wi’ right guid will;<br>
      The cantie auld folks crackin crouse,<br>
      The young anes rantin thro’ the house—<br>
      My heart has been sae fain to see them,<br>
      That I for joy hae barkit wi’ them.<br>
        Still it’s owre true that ye hae said,<br>
      Sic game is now owre aften play’d;<br>
      There’s mony a creditable stock<br>
      O’ decent, honest, fawsont folk,<br>
      Are riven out baith root an’ branch,<br>
      Some rascal’s pridefu’ greed to quench,<br>
      Wha thinks to knit himsel the faster<br>
      In favour wi’ some gentle master,<br>
      Wha, aiblins, thrang a parliamentin,<br>
      For Britain’s guid his saul indentin—
      </p>

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        Haith, lad, ye little ken about it:<br>
      For Britain’s guid! guid faith! I doubt it.<br>
      Say rather, gaun as Premiers lead him:<br>
      An’ saying ay or no’s they bid him:<br>
      At operas an’ plays parading,<br>
      Mortgaging, gambling, masquerading:<br>
      Or maybe, in a frolic daft,<br>
      To Hague or Calais takes a waft,<br>
      To mak a tour an’ tak a whirl,<br>
      To learn bon ton, an’ see the worl’.<br>
        There, at Vienna, or Versailles,<br>
      He rives his father’s auld entails;<br>
      Or by Madrid he takes the rout,<br>
      To thrum guitars an’ fecht wi’ nowt;<br>
      Or down Italian vista startles,<br>
        Wh-re-hunting amang groves o’ myrtles:<br>
      Then bowses drumlie German-water,<br>
      To mak himsel look fair an’ fatter,<br>
      An’ clear the consequential sorrows,<br>
      Love-gifts of Carnival signoras.<br>
        For Britain’s guid! for her destruction!<br>
      Wi’ dissipation, feud, an’ faction.
      </p>

      <h3>LUATH</h3>

      <p>
        Hech, man! dear sirs! is that the gate<br>
      They waste sae mony a braw estate!<br>
      Are we sae foughten an’ harass’d<br>
      For gear to gang that gate at last?<br>
        O would they stay aback frae courts,<br>
      An’ please themsels wi’ country sports,<br>
      It wad for ev’ry ane be better,<br>
      The laird, the tenant, an’ the cotter!<br>
      For thae frank, rantin, ramblin billies,<br>
      Feint haet o’ them’s ill-hearted fellows;<br>
      Except for breakin o’ their timmer,<br>
      Or speakin lightly o’ their limmer,<br>
      Or shootin of a hare or moor-cock,<br>
      The ne’er-a-bit they’re ill to poor folk,<br>
        But will ye tell me, Master Cæsar,<br>
      Sure great folk’s life’s a life o’ pleasure?<br>
      Nae cauld nor hunger e’er can steer them,<br>
      The very thought o’t need na fear them.
      </p>

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        L—d, man, were ye but whiles whare I am,<br>
      The gentles, ye wad ne’er envy them!<br>
        It’s true, they need na starve or sweat,<br>
      Thro’ winter’s cauld, or simmer’s heat:<br>
      They’ve nae sair wark to craze their banes,<br>
      An’ fill auld age wi’ grips an’ granes:<br>
      But human bodies are sic fools,<br>
      For a’ their colleges an’ schools,<br>
      That when nae real ills perplex them,<br>
      They mak enow themsel’s to vex them;<br>
      An’ aye the less they hae to sturt them,<br>
      In like proportion, less will hurt them.<br>
        A country fellow at the pleugh,<br>
      His acre’s till’d, he’s right eneugh;<br>
      A country girl at her wheel,<br>
      Her dizzen’s dune, she’s unco weel;<br>
      But gentlemen, an’ ladies warst,<br>
      Wi’ ev’n-down want o’ wark are curst.<br>
      They loiter, lounging, lank an’ lazy;<br>
      Tho’ deil-haet ails them, yet uneasy;<br>
      Their days insipid, dull, an’ tasteless;<br>
      Their nights unquiet, lang, an’ restless.<br>
        An’ev’n their sports, their balls an’ races,<br>
      Their galloping through public places,<br>
      There’s sic parade, sic pomp, an’ art,<br>
      The joy can scarcely reach the heart.<br>
        The men cast out in party-matches,<br>
      Then sowther a’ in deep debauches.<br>
      Ae night they’re mad wi’ drink an’ whoring,<br>
      Niest day their life is past enduring.<br>
        The ladies arm-in-arm in clusters,<br>
      As great an’ gracious a’ as sisters;<br>
      But hear their absent thoughts o’ ither,<br>
      They’re a’ run-deils an’ jads thegither.<br>
      Whiles, owre the wee bit cup an’ platie,<br>
      They sip the scandal-potion pretty;<br>
      Or lee-lang nights, wi’ crabbit leuks<br>
      Pore owre the devil’s pictur’d beuks;<br>
      Stake on a chance a farmer’s stackyard,<br>
      An’ cheat like ony unhanged blackguard.<br>
        There’s some exceptions, man an’ woman;<br>
      But this is gentry’s life in common.<br>
        By this, the sun was out of sight,<br>
      An’ darker gloamin brought the night;<br>
      The bum-clock humm’d wi’ lazy drone;<br>
      The kye stood rowtin i’ the loan;<br>
      When up they gat an’ shook their lugs,<br>
      Rejoic’d they werena men but dogs;<br>
      An’ each took aff his several way,<br>
      Resolv’d to meet some ither day.
