        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" target="_blank">Robert Burns</a> (25 January 1759 – 21 July 1796)
          was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.
          He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature.

      <h2>The Twa Dogs</h2>

      <h2>A TALE</h2>

      <p>
        ’TWAS in that place o’ Scotland’s isle, <br>
        That bears the name o’ <span class="tooltip">auld<span class="tooltiptext">old</span></span> King Coil,<br>
        Upon a <span class="tooltip">bonie<span class="tooltiptext">lovely</span></span> day in June,<br>
        When wearin’ thro’ the afternoon,<br>
        <span class="tooltip">Twa<span class="tooltiptext">two</span></span> dogs, that were na <span class="tooltip">thrang<span class="tooltiptext">busy</span></span> at hame,<br>
        Forgather’d ance upon a time.<br>
          The first I’ll name, they ca’d him Caesar,<br>
        Was keepit for His Honor’s pleasure:<br>
        His hair, his size, his mouth, his <span class="tooltip">lugs<span class="tooltiptext">ears</span></span>,<br>
        Shew’d he was nane o’ Scotland’s dogs;<br>
        But <span class="tooltip">whalpit<span class="tooltiptext">bred</span></span> some place far abroad,<br>
        Whare sailors gang to fish for cod.<br>
          His locked, letter’d, <span class="tooltip">braw<span class="tooltiptext">lovely</span></span> brass collar<br>
        Shew’d him the gentleman an’ scholar;<br>
        But though he was o’ high degree,<br>
        The <span class="tooltip">fient<span class="tooltiptext">fiend</span></span> a pride, nae pride had he;<br>
        But wad hae spent an hour caressin,<br>
        Ev’n wi’ al tinkler-gipsy’s <span class="tooltip">messin<span class="tooltiptext">mongrel</span></span>:<br>
        At <span class="tooltip">kirk<span class="tooltiptext">church</span></span> or market, mill or <span class="tooltip">smiddie<span class="tooltiptext">smithy</span></span>,<br>
        Nae tawted <span class="tooltip">tyke<span class="tooltiptext">cur; an aggressive dog or one that is in poor condition, especially a mongrel.</span></span>, tho’ e’er sae <span class="tooltip">duddie<span class="tooltiptext">ragged</span></span>,<br>
        But he wad stan’t, as glad to see him,<br>
        An’ <span class="tooltip">stroan’t<span class="tooltiptext">urinated</span></span> on stanes an’ hillocks wi’ him.<br>
          The tither was a ploughman’s collie—<br>
        A rhyming, ranting, raving billie,<br>
        Wha for his friend an’ comrade had him,<br>
        And in <span class="tooltip">freak<span class="tooltiptext">youth</span></span> had Luath ca’d him,<br>
        After some dog in Highland Sang,<br>
        Was made lang syne,—Lord knows how lang.<br>
          He was a gash an’ faithfu’ tyke,<br>
        As ever lap a sheugh or dyke.<br>
        His honest, sonsie, <span class="tooltip">baws’nt<span class="tooltiptext">white streaked</span></span> face<br>
        Aye gat him friends in ilka place;<br>
        His breast was white, his touzie back<br>
        Weel clad wi’ coat o’ glossy black;<br>
        His gawsie tail, wi’ upward curl,<br>
        Hung owre his <span class="tooltip">hurdie’s<span class="tooltiptext">buttocks</span></span> wi’ a swirl.<br>
          Nae doubt but they were fain o’ ither,<br>
        And unco pack an’ thick thegither;<br>
        Wi’ social nose whiles snuff’d an’ snowkit;<br>
        Whiles mice an’ moudieworts they <span class="tooltip">howkit<span class="tooltiptext">dug</span></span>;<br>
        Whiles scour’d awa’ in lang excursion,<br>
        An’ worry’d ither in diversion;<br>
        Until wi’ daffin’ weary grown<br>
        Upon a knowe they set them down.<br>
        An’ there began a lang digression.<br>
        About the “lords o’ the creation.”

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        I’ve aften wonder’d, honest Luath,<br>
      What sort o’ life poor dogs like you have;<br>
      An’ when the gentry’s life I saw,<br>
      What way poor bodies liv’d <span class="tooltip">ava<span class="tooltiptext">at all</span></span>.<br>
        Our laird gets in his racked rents,<br>
      His coals, his kane, an’ a’ his <span class="tooltip">stents<span class="tooltiptext">dues</span></span>:<br>
      He rises when he likes himsel’;<br>
      His flunkies answer at the bell;<br>
      He ca’s his coach; he ca’s his horse;<br>
      He draws a bonie silken purse,<br>
      As lang’s my tail, where, thro’ the <span class="tooltip">steeks<span class="tooltiptext">stiches</span></span>,<br>
      The yellow letter’d Geordie keeks.<br>
        Frae morn to e’en, it’s nought but toiling<br>
      At baking, roasting, frying, boiling;<br>
      An’ tho’ the gentry first are stechin,<br>
      Yet ev’n the ha’ folk fill their <span class="tooltip">pechan<span class="tooltiptext">stomach</span></span><br>
      Wi’ sauce, ragouts, an’ sic like trashtrie,<br>
      That’s little short o’ downright wastrie.<br>
      Our whipper-in, wee, blasted wonner,<br>
      Poor, worthless elf, it eats a dinner,<br>
      Better than ony tenant-man<br>
      His Honour has in a’ the lan’:<br>
      An’ what poor cot-folk pit their painch in,<br>
      I own it’s past my comprehension.
      </p>

      <h3>LUATH</h3>

      <p>
        Trowth, Cæsar, whiles they’re <span class="tooltip">fash’t<span class="tooltiptext">bothered</span></span> eneugh:<br>
      A cottar <span class="tooltip">howkin<span class="tooltiptext">digging</span></span> in a <span class="tooltip">sheugh<span class="tooltiptext">ditch</span></span>,<br>
      Wi’ dirty stanes biggin a dyke,<br>
      Baring a quarry, an’ sic like;<br>
      Himsel’, a wife, he thus sustains,<br>
      A smytrie o’ wee duddie <span class="tooltip">weans<span class="tooltiptext">children</span></span>,<br>
      An’ nought but his han’-daurk, to keep<br>
      Them right an’ tight in thack an’ <span class="tooltip">rape<span class="tooltiptext">rope</span></span>.<br>
        An’ when they meet wi’ sair disasters,<br>
      Like loss o’ health or want o’ masters,<br>
      Ye maist wad think, a wee touch langer,<br>
      An’ they maun starve o’ cauld an’ hunger:<br>
      But how it comes, I never <span class="tooltip">kent<span class="tooltiptext">knew</span></span> yet,<br>
      They’re maistly wonderfu’ contented;<br>
      An’ buirdly <span class="tooltip">chiels<span class="tooltiptext">lads</span></span>, an’ clever <span class="tooltip">hizzies<span class="tooltiptext">women</span></span>,<br>
      Are bred in sic a way as this is.
      </p>

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        But then to see how ye’re negleckit,<br>
      How huff’d, an’ cuff’d, an’ disrespeckit!<br>
      Lord man, our gentry care as little<br>
      For delvers, ditchers, an’ sic cattle;<br>
      They gang as saucy by poor folk,<br>
      As I wad by a stinkin <span class="tooltip">brock<span class="tooltiptext">badger</span></span>.<br>
        I’ve notic’d, on our laird’s court-day,—<br>
      An’ mony a time my heart’s been wae,—<br>
      Poor tenant bodies, scant o’cash,<br>
      How they maun <span class="tooltip">thole<span class="tooltiptext">endure</span></span> a factor’s snash;<br>
      He’ll stamp an’ threaten, curse an’ swear<br>
      He’ll apprehend them, <span class="tooltip">poind<span class="tooltiptext">seize</span></span> their gear;<br>
      While they maun stan’, wi’ aspect humble,<br>
      An’ hear it a’, an’ fear an’ tremble!<br>
        I see how folk live that hae riches;<br>
      But surely poor-folk maun be wretches!
      </p>

      <h3>LUATH</h3>

      <p>
        They’re no sae wretched’s ane wad think.<br>
      Tho’ constantly on poortith’s brink,<br>
      They’re sae accustom’d wi’ the sight,<br>
      The view o’t gives them little fright.<br>
        Then chance and fortune are sae guided,<br>
      They’re aye in less or mair provided:<br>
      An’ tho’ fatigued wi’ close employment,<br>
      A blink o’ rest’s a sweet enjoyment.<br>
        The dearest comfort o’ their lives,<br>
      Their <span class="tooltip">grushie<span class="tooltiptext">growing</span></span> weans an’ faithfu’ wives;<br>
      The prattling things are just their pride,<br>
      That sweetens a’ their fire-side.<br>
        An’ whiles twalpennie worth o’ <span class="tooltip">nappy<span class="tooltiptext">ale</span></span><br>
      Can mak the bodies <span class="tooltip">unco<span class="tooltiptext">uncommonly</span></span> happy:<br>
      They lay aside their private cares,<br>
      To mind the Kirk and State affairs;<br>
      They’ll talk o’ patronage an’ priests,<br>
      Wi’ kindling fury i’ their breasts,<br>
      Or tell what new taxation’s comin,<br>
      An’ <span class="tooltip">ferlie<span class="tooltiptext">wonder</span></span> at the folk in Lon’on.<br>
        As bleak-fac’d Hallowmass returns,<br>
      They get the jovial, rantin kirns,<br>
      When rural life, of ev’ry station,<br>
      Unite in common recreation;<br>
      Love blinks, Wit slaps, an’ social Mirth<br>
      Forgets there’s Care upo’ the earth.<br>
        That merry day the year begins,<br>
      They bar the door on frosty win’s;<br>
      The nappy <span class="tooltip">reeks<span class="tooltiptext">steams</span></span> wi’ mantling ream,<br>
      An’ sheds a heart-inspiring steam;<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">luntin<span class="tooltiptext">smoking</span></span> pipe, an’ sneeshin mill,<br>
      Are handed round wi’ right guid will;<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">cantie<span class="tooltiptext">merry</span></span> auld folks crackin crouse,<br>
      The young anes rantin thro’ the house—<br>
      My heart has been sae <span class="tooltip">fain<span class="tooltiptext">happy</span></span> to see them,<br>
      That I for joy hae barkit wi’ them.<br>
        Still it’s owre true that ye hae said,<br>
      Sic game is now owre aften play’d;<br>
      There’s mony a creditable stock<br>
      O’ decent, honest, <span class="tooltip">fawsont<span class="tooltiptext">well-doing</span></span> folk,<br>
      Are riven out baith root an’ branch,<br>
      Some rascal’s pridefu’ greed to quench,<br>
      Wha thinks to knit himsel the faster<br>
      In favour wi’ some gentle master,<br>
      Wha, aiblins, thrang a parliamentin,<br>
      For Britain’s guid his saul indentin—
      </p>

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        Haith, lad, ye little ken about it:<br>
      For Britain’s guid! guid faith! I doubt it.<br>
      Say rather, gaun as Premiers lead him:<br>
      An’ saying ay or no’s they bid him:<br>
      At operas an’ plays parading,<br>
      Mortgaging, gambling, masquerading:<br>
      Or maybe, in a frolic daft,<br>
      To Hague or Calais takes a waft,<br>
      To mak a tour an’ tak a whirl,<br>
      To learn bon ton, an’ see the worl’.<br>
        There, at Vienna, or Versailles,<br>
      He rives his father’s auld entails;<br>
      Or by Madrid he takes the rout,<br>
      To thrum guitars an’ fecht wi’ <span class="tooltip">nowt<span class="tooltiptext">cattle</span></span>;<br>
      Or down Italian vista startles,<br>
        Wh-re-hunting amang groves o’ myrtles:<br>
      Then <span class="tooltip">bowses<span class="tooltiptext">drinks</span></span> drumlie German-water,<br>
      To mak himsel look fair an’ fatter,<br>
      An’ clear the consequential sorrows,<br>
      Love-gifts of Carnival signoras.<br>
        For Britain’s guid! for her destruction!<br>
      Wi’ dissipation, feud, an’ faction.
      </p>

      <h3>LUATH</h3>

      <p>
        Hech, man! dear sirs! is that the gate<br>
      They waste sae mony a braw estate!<br>
      Are we sae foughten an’ harass’d<br>
      For gear to gang that gate at last?<br>
        O would they stay aback frae courts,<br>
      An’ please themsels wi’ country sports,<br>
      It wad for ev’ry ane be better,<br>
      The laird, the tenant, an’ the cotter!<br>
      For thae frank, rantin, ramblin billies,<br>
      Feint haet o’ them’s ill-hearted fellows;<br>
      Except for breakin o’ their <span class="tooltip">timmer<span class="tooltiptext">timber</span></span>,<br>
      Or speakin lightly o’ their <span class="tooltip">limmer<span class="tooltiptext">mistress</span></span>,<br>
      Or shootin of a hare or moor-cock,<br>
      The ne’er-a-bit they’re ill to poor folk,<br>
        But will ye tell me, Master Cæsar,<br>
      Sure great folk’s life’s a life o’ pleasure?<br>
      Nae cauld nor hunger e’er can steer them,<br>
      The very thought o’t need na fear them.
      </p>

      <h3>CÆSAR</h3>

      <p>
        L—d, man, were ye but whiles whare I am,<br>
      The gentles, ye wad ne’er envy them!<br>
        It’s true, they need na starve or sweat,<br>
      Thro’ winter’s cauld, or simmer’s heat:<br>
      They’ve nae sair wark to craze their banes,<br>
      An’ fill auld age wi’ grips an’ granes:<br>
      But human bodies are sic fools,<br>
      For a’ their colleges an’ schools,<br>
      That when nae real ills perplex them,<br>
      They mak enow themsel’s to vex them;<br>
      An’ aye the less they hae to sturt them,<br>
      In like proportion, less will hurt them.<br>
        A country fellow at the pleugh,<br>
      His acre’s till’d, he’s right eneugh;<br>
      A country girl at her wheel,<br>
      Her <span class="tooltip">dizzen’s<span class="tooltiptext">dozen</span></span> dune, she’s unco <span class="tooltip">weel<span class="tooltiptext">well; satisfied</span></span>;<br>
      But gentlemen, an’ ladies warst,<br>
      Wi’ ev’n-down want o’ wark are curst.<br>
      They loiter, lounging, lank an’ lazy;<br>
      Tho’ <span class="tooltip">deil-haet<span class="tooltiptext">devil have it</span></span> ails them, yet uneasy;<br>
      Their days insipid, dull, an’ tasteless;<br>
      Their nights unquiet, lang, an’ restless.<br>
        An’ev’n their sports, their balls an’ races,<br>
      Their galloping through public places,<br>
      There’s sic parade, sic pomp, an’ art,<br>
      The joy can scarcely reach the heart.<br>
        The men cast out in party-matches,<br>
      Then sowther a’ in deep debauches.<br>
      Ae night they’re mad wi’ drink an’ whoring,<br>
      Niest day their life is past enduring.<br>
        The ladies arm-in-arm in clusters,<br>
      As great an’ gracious a’ as sisters;<br>
      But hear their absent thoughts o’ ither,<br>
      They’re a’ run-deils an’ <span class="tooltip">jads<span class="tooltiptext">old women</span></span> thegither.<br>
      Whiles, owre the wee bit cup an’ platie,<br>
      They sip the scandal-potion pretty;<br>
      Or lee-lang nights, wi’ crabbit leuks<br>
      Pore owre the devil’s pictur’d beuks;<br>
      Stake on a chance a farmer’s stackyard,<br>
      An’ cheat like ony unhanged blackguard.<br>
        There’s some exceptions, man an’ woman;<br>
      But this is gentry’s life in common.<br>
        By this, the sun was out of sight,<br>
      An’ darker <span class="tooltip">gloamin<span class="tooltiptext">twilight</span></span> brought the night;<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">bum-clock<span class="tooltiptext">a beetle</span></span> humm’d wi’ lazy drone;<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">kye<span class="tooltiptext">cattle</span></span> stood <span class="tooltip">rowtin<span class="tooltiptext">lowing</span></span> i’ the loan;<br>
      When up they gat an’ shook their lugs,<br>
      Rejoic’d they werena men but dogs;<br>
      An’ each took aff his several way,<br>
      Resolv’d to meet some ither day.
