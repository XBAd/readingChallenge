          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning" target="_blank">Robert Browning</a>
          (7 May 1812 – 12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic
          monologue made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. His poems are
          known for their irony, characterization, dark humour, social commentary,
          historical settings, and challenging vocabulary and syntax.
          When Browning died in 1889, he was regarded as a sage and philosopher-poet
          who through his writing had made contributions to Victorian social
          and political discourse. Unusually for a poet, societies for the study
          of his work were founded while he was still alive. Such Browning
          Societies remained common in Britain and the United States until the
          early 20th century.

      <h2>My Last Duchess</h2>

      <h2>Ferrara</h2>

      <p>
        THAT’S my last Duchess painted on the wall, <br>
        Looking as if she were alive. I call<br>
        That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf’s hands<br>
        Worked busily a day, and there she stands.<br>
        Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said<br>
        “Frà Pandolf” by design, for never read<br>
        Strangers like you that pictured <span class="tooltip">countenance<span class="tooltiptext">a person's face or facial expression.</span></span>,<br>
        The depth and passion of its earnest glance,<br>
        But to myself they turned (since none puts by<br>
        The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)<br>
        And seemed as they would ask me, if they <span class="tooltip">durst<span class="tooltiptext">archaic or regional past of dare.</span></span>,<br>
        How such a glance came there; so, not the first<br>
        Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not<br>
        Her husband’s presence only, called that spot<br>
        Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps<br>
        Frà Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps<br>
        Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint<br>
        Must never hope to reproduce the faint<br>
        Half-flush that dies along her throat:” such stuff<br>
        Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough<br>
        For calling up that spot of joy. She had<br>
        A heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad.<br>
        Too easily impressed: she liked whate’er<br>
        She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.<br>
        Sir, ’twas all one! My favor at her breast,<br>
        The dropping of the daylight in the West,<br>
        The bough of cherries some <span class="tooltip">officious<span class="tooltiptext">assertive of authority in an annoyingly domineering way, especially with regard to petty or trivial matters.</span></span> fool<br>
        Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule<br>
        She rode with round the terrace—all and each<br>
        Would draw from her alike the approving speech,<br>
        Or blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked<br>
        Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked<br>
        My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name<br>
        With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame<br>
        This sort of trifling? Even had you skill<br>
        In speech—(which I have not)—to make your will<br>
        Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this<br>
        Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,<br>
        Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let<br>
        Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set<br>
        Her wits to yours, <span class="tooltip">forsooth<span class="tooltiptext">indeed (often used ironically or to express surprise or indignation).</span></span>, and made excuse,<br>
        —E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose<br>
        Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,<br>
        Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without<br>
        Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;<br>
        Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands<br>
        As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet<br>
        The company below, then. I repeat,<br>
        The Count your master’s known <span class="tooltip">munificence<span class="tooltiptext">the quality or action of being lavishly generous; great generosity.</span></span><br>
        Is ample warrant that no just pretence<br>
        Of mine for <span class="tooltip">dowry<span class="tooltiptext">property or money brought by a bride to her husband on their marriage.</span></span> will be disallowed;<br>
        Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed<br>
        At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go<br>
        Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,<br>
        Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,<br>
        Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

      <h2>The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed’s Church Rome, 15—</h2>

      <p>
        VANITY, saith the preacher, vanity!<br>
        Draw round my bed: is <span class="tooltip">Anselm<span class="tooltiptext">Anselm of Canterbury (1033—1109), one of the most important Christian thinkers of the eleventh century</span></span> keeping back?<br>
        Nephews—sons mine … ah God, I know not! Well—<br>
        She, men would have to be your mother once,<br>
        Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was!<br>
        What’s done is done, and she is dead beside,<br>
        Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since,<br>
        And as she died so must we die ourselves,<br>
        And thence ye may perceive the world’s a dream.<br>
        Life, how and what is it? As here I lie<br>
        In this state-chamber, dying by degrees,<br>
        Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask<br>
        “Do I live, am I dead?” Peace, peace seems all.<br>
        Saint Praxed’s ever was the church for peace;<br>
        And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought<br>
        With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know:<br>
        —Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care;<br>
        Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South<br>
        He graced his <span class="tooltip">carrion<span class="tooltiptext">the decaying flesh of dead animals.</span></span> with, God curse the same!<br>
        Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence<br>
        One sees the pulpit o’ the <span class="tooltip">epistle-side<span class="tooltiptext"> the side of a church on which the Epistle is read during the Mass or Eucharist</span></span>,<br>
        And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats,<br>
        And up into the very dome where live<br>
        The angels, and a sunbeam’s sure to lurk:<br>
        And I shall fill my slab of basalt there,<br>
        And ’neath my tabernacle take my rest,<br>
        With those nine columns round me, two and two,<br>
        The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands:<br>
        Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe<br>
        As fresh poured red wine of a mighty pulse<br>
        —Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone,<br>
        Put me where I may look at him! True peach,<br>
        Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize!<br>
        Draw close: that conflagration of my church<br>
        —What then? So much was saved if aught were missed!<br>
        My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig<br>
        The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood,<br>
        Drop water gently till the surface sink,<br>
        And if ye find … Ah God, I know not, I! …<br>
        Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft,<br>
        And corded up in a tight olive-frail,<br>
        Some lump, ah God, of <span class="tooltip">lapis lazuli<span class="tooltiptext">a bright blue metamorphic rock consisting largely of lazurite, used for decoration and in jewelry.</span></span>,<br>
        Big as a Jew’s head cut off at the nape,<br>
        Blue as a vein o’er the Madonna’s breast<br>
        Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all,<br>
        That brave Frascati villa with its bath,<br>
        So, let the blue lump poise between my knees,<br>
        Like God the Father’s globe on both his hands<br>
        Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay,<br>
        For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst!<br>
        Swift as a weaver’s shuttle fleet our years:<br>
        Man goeth to the grave, and where is he?<br>
        Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black—<br>
        ’Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else<br>
        Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath?<br>
        The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me.<br>
        Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance<br>
        Some tripod, <span class="tooltip">thyrsus<span class="tooltiptext">(in ancient Greece and Rome) a staff or spear tipped with an ornament like a pine cone, carried by Bacchus and his followers.</span></span>, with a vase or so,<br>
        The Saviour at his sermon on the mount,<br>
        Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan<br>
        Ready to twitch the Nymph’s last garment off,<br>
        And Moses with the tables … but I know<br>
        Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee,<br>
        Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope<br>
        To revel down my villas while I gasp<br>
        Bricked o’er with beggar’s mouldy <span class="tooltip">travertine<span class="tooltiptext">a type of limestone that forms around mineral spring deposits</span></span><br>
        Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at!<br>
        Nay, boys, ye love me—all of jasper, then!<br>
        ’Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve.<br>
        My bath must needs be left behind, alas!<br>
        One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut,<br>
        There’s plenty jasper somewhere in the world—<br>
        And have I not Saint Praxed’s ear to pray<br>
        Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts,<br>
        And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs?<br>
        —That’s if ye carve my epitaph aright,<br>
        Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully’s every word,<br>
        No gaudy ware like Gandolf’s second line—<br>
        Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need!<br>
        And then how I shall lie through centuries,<br>
        And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,<br>
        And see God made and eaten all day long,<br>
        And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste<br>
        Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!<br>
        For as I lie here, hours of the dead night,<br>
        Dying in state and by such slow degrees,<br>
        I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook,<br>
        And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point,<br>
        And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop<br>
        Into great laps and folds of sculptor’s work:<br>
        And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts<br>
        Grow, with a certain humming in my ears,<br>
        About the life before I lived this life,<br>
        And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests,<br>
        Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount,<br>
        Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes,<br>
        And new-found agate urns as fresh as day,<br>
        And marble’s language, Latin pure, discreet,<br>
        —Aha, ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend?<br>
        No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best!<br>
        Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage.<br>
        All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope<br>
        My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart?<br>
        Ever your eyes were as a lizard’s quick,<br>
        They glitter like your mother’s for my soul,<br>
        Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze,<br>
        Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase<br>
        With grapes, and add a visor and a Term,<br>
        And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx<br>
        That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down,<br>
        To comfort me on my entablature<br>
        Whereon I am to lie till I must ask<br>
        “Do I live, am I dead?” There, leave me, there!<br>
        For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude<br>
        To death—ye wish it—God, ye wish it! Stone—<br>
        Gritstone, a crumble! Clammy squares which sweat<br>
        As if the corpse they keep were oozing through—<br>
        And no more lapis to delight the world!<br>
        Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there,<br>
        But in a row: and, going, turn your backs<br>
        —Ay, like departing altar-ministrants,<br>
        And leave me in my church, the church for peace,<br>
        That I may watch at leisure if he leers—<br>
        Old Gandolf—at me, from his onion-stone,<br>
        As still he envied me, so fair she was!
