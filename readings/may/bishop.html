      <h2>My Last Duchess</h2>

      <h2>Ferrara</h2>

      <p>
        THAT’S my last Duchess painted on the wall, <br>
        Looking as if she were alive. I call<br>
        That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf’s hands<br>
        Worked busily a day, and there she stands.<br>
        Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said<br>
        “Frà Pandolf” by design, for never read<br>
        Strangers like you that pictured countenance,<br>
        The depth and passion of its earnest glance,<br>
        But to myself they turned (since none puts by<br>
        The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)<br>
        And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,<br>
        How such a glance came there; so, not the first<br>
        Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not<br>
        Her husband’s presence only, called that spot<br>
        Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps<br>
        Frà Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps<br>
        Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint<br>
        Must never hope to reproduce the faint<br>
        Half-flush that dies along her throat:” such stuff<br>
        Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough<br>
        For calling up that spot of joy. She had<br>
        A heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad.<br>
        Too easily impressed: she liked whate’er<br>
        She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.<br>
        Sir, ’twas all one! My favor at her breast,<br>
        The dropping of the daylight in the West,<br>
        The bough of cherries some officious fool<br>
        Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule<br>
        She rode with round the terrace—all and each<br>
        Would draw from her alike the approving speech,<br>
        Or blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked<br>
        Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked<br>
        My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name<br>
        With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame<br>
        This sort of trifling? Even had you skill<br>
        In speech—(which I have not)—to make your will<br>
        Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this<br>
        Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,<br>
        Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let<br>
        Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set<br>
        Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,<br>
        —E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose<br>
        Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,<br>
        Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without<br>
        Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;<br>
        Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands<br>
        As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet<br>
        The company below, then. I repeat,<br>
        The Count your master’s known munificence<br>
        Is ample warrant that no just pretence<br>
        Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;<br>
        Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed<br>
        At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go<br>
        Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,<br>
        Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,<br>
        Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

      <h2>The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed’s Church Rome, 15—</h2>

      <p>
        VANITY, saith the preacher, vanity!<br>
        Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back?<br>
        Nephews—sons mine … ah God, I know not! Well—<br>
        She, men would have to be your mother once,<br>
        Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was!<br>
        What’s done is done, and she is dead beside,<br>
        Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since,<br>
        And as she died so must we die ourselves,<br>
        And thence ye may perceive the world’s a dream.<br>
        Life, how and what is it? As here I lie<br>
        In this state-chamber, dying by degrees,<br>
        Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask<br>
        “Do I live, am I dead?” Peace, peace seems all.<br>
        Saint Praxed’s ever was the church for peace;<br>
        And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought<br>
        With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know:<br>
        —Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care;<br>
        Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South<br>
        He graced his carrion with, God curse the same!<br>
        Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence<br>
        One sees the pulpit o’ the epistle-side,<br>
        And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats,<br>
        And up into the very dome where live<br>
        The angels, and a sunbeam’s sure to lurk:<br>
        And I shall fill my slab of basalt there,<br>
        And ’neath my tabernacle take my rest,<br>
        With those nine columns round me, two and two,<br>
        The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands:<br>
        Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe<br>
        As fresh poured red wine of a mighty pulse<br>
        —Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone,<br>
        Put me where I may look at him! True peach,<br>
        Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize!<br>
        Draw close: that conflagration of my church<br>
        —What then? So much was saved if aught were missed!<br>
        My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig<br>
        The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood,<br>
        Drop water gently till the surface sink,<br>
        And if ye find … Ah God, I know not, I! …<br>
        Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft,<br>
        And corded up in a tight olive-frail,<br>
        Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli,<br>
        Big as a Jew’s head cut off at the nape,<br>
        Blue as a vein o’er the Madonna’s breast<br>
        Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all,<br>
        That brave Frascati villa with its bath,<br>
        So, let the blue lump poise between my knees,<br>
        Like God the Father’s globe on both his hands<br>
        Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay,<br>
        For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst!<br>
        Swift as a weaver’s shuttle fleet our years:<br>
        Man goeth to the grave, and where is he?<br>
        Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black—<br>
        ’Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else<br>
        Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath?<br>
        The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me.<br>
        Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance<br>
        Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,<br>
        The Saviour at his sermon on the mount,<br>
        Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan<br>
        Ready to twitch the Nymph’s last garment off,<br>
        And Moses with the tables … but I know<br>
        Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee,<br>
        Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope<br>
        To revel down my villas while I gasp<br>
        Bricked o’er with beggar’s mouldy travertine<br>
        Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at!<br>
        Nay, boys, ye love me—all of jasper, then!<br>
        ’Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve.<br>
        My bath must needs be left behind, alas!<br>
        One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut,<br>
        There’s plenty jasper somewhere in the world—<br>
        And have I not Saint Praxed’s ear to pray<br>
        Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts,<br>
        And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs?<br>
        —That’s if ye carve my epitaph aright,<br>
        Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully’s every word,<br>
        No gaudy ware like Gandolf’s second line—<br>
        Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need!<br>
        And then how I shall lie through centuries,<br>
        And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,<br>
        And see God made and eaten all day long,<br>
        And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste<br>
        Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!<br>
        For as I lie here, hours of the dead night,<br>
        Dying in state and by such slow degrees,<br>
        I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook,<br>
        And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point,<br>
        And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop<br>
        Into great laps and folds of sculptor’s work:<br>
        And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts<br>
        Grow, with a certain humming in my ears,<br>
        About the life before I lived this life,<br>
        And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests,<br>
        Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount,<br>
        Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes,<br>
        And new-found agate urns as fresh as day,<br>
        And marble’s language, Latin pure, discreet,<br>
        —Aha, ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend?<br>
        No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best!<br>
        Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage.<br>
        All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope<br>
        My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart?<br>
        Ever your eyes were as a lizard’s quick,<br>
        They glitter like your mother’s for my soul,<br>
        Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze,<br>
        Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase<br>
        With grapes, and add a visor and a Term,<br>
        And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx<br>
        That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down,<br>
        To comfort me on my entablature<br>
        Whereon I am to lie till I must ask<br>
        “Do I live, am I dead?” There, leave me, there!<br>
        For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude<br>
        To death—ye wish it—God, ye wish it! Stone—<br>
        Gritstone, a crumble! Clammy squares which sweat<br>
        As if the corpse they keep were oozing through—<br>
        And no more lapis to delight the world!<br>
        Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there,<br>
        But in a row: and, going, turn your backs<br>
        —Ay, like departing altar-ministrants,<br>
        And leave me in my church, the church for peace,<br>
        That I may watch at leisure if he leers—<br>
        Old Gandolf—at me, from his onion-stone,<br>
        As still he envied me, so fair she was!
