        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy" target="_blank"><em>The Divine Comedy</em></a>
           is a long Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308
           and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely
           considered to be the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one
           of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative
           vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view
           as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century.
           It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written
           (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the
           standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts:
           <em>Inferno</em>, <em>Purgatorio</em>, and <em>Paradiso</em>.
           The narrative describes Dante's travels through Hell,
           Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven, while allegorically the poem
           represents the soul's journey towards God. Dante draws on medieval
           Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy
           derived from the <em>Summa Theologica</em> of Thomas Aquinas.
           Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called "the Summa in verse".
           In Dante's work, Virgil is presented as human reason and
           Beatrice is presented as divine knowledge.

      <h2>Inferno [Hell]</h2>

      <h2>Canto XXV</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—The sacrilegious Fucci vents his fury in blasphemy, is seized by serpents, and flying is pursued by Cacus in the form of a Centaur, who is described with a swarm of serpents on his haunch, and a dragon on his shoulders breathing forth fire. Our Poet then meets with the spirits of three of his countrymen, two of whom undergo a marvelous transformation in his presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        WHEN he had spoke, the sinner raised his hands <br>
        Pointed in mockery and cried” “Take them, God!<br>
        I level them at thee.” From that day forth<br>
        The serpents were my friends; for round his neck<br>
        One of them rolling twisted, as it said,<br>
        “Be silent, tongue!” Another, to his arms<br>
        Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself<br>
        So close, it took from them the power to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pistoia! ah, Pistoia! why dost doubt<br>
      To turn thee into ashes, cumbering earth<br>
      No longer, since in evil act so far<br>
      Thou hast outdone thy seed? I did not mark,<br>
      Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss,<br>
      Spirit, that swell’d so proudly ’gainst his God;<br>
      Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled,<br>
      Nor utter’d more; and after him there came<br>
      A Centaur full of fury, shouting, “Where,<br>
      Where is the <span class="tooltip">caitiff<span class="tooltiptext">a contemptible or cowardly person.</span></span>?” On <span class="tooltip">Maremma<span class="tooltiptext">The Maremma is a coastal area of western central Italy, bordering the Tyrrhenian Sea. It includes much of south-western Tuscany and part of northern Lazio.</span></span>’s marsh<br>
      Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch<br>
      They swarm’d, to where the human face begins.<br>
      Behind his head, upon the shoulders, lay<br>
      With open wings a dragon, breathing fire<br>
      On whomsoe’er he met. To me my guide:<br>
      “Cacus is this, who underneath the rock<br>
      Of <span class="tooltip">Aventine<span class="tooltiptext">one of the seven hills on which ancient Rome was built</span></span> spread oft a lake of blood.<br>
      He, from his brethren parted, here must tread<br>
      A different journey, for his fraudful theft<br>
      Of the great herd that near him stall’d; whence found<br>
      His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace<br>
      Of stout <span class="tooltip">Alcides<span class="tooltiptext">Hercules; a hero in classical mythology noted for his strength</span></span>, that perchance laid on<br>
      A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.”
      </p>

      <p>
        While yet he spake, the Centaur sped away:<br>
      And under us three spirits came, of whom<br>
      Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim’d,<br>
      “Say who are ye!” We then brake off discourse,<br>
      Intent on these alone. I knew them not:<br>
      But, as it chanceth oft, befell that one<br>
      Had need to name another. “Where,” said he,<br>
      “Doth Cianfa lurk?” I, for a sign my guide<br>
      Should stand attentive, placed against my lips<br>
      The finger lifted. If, O reader! now<br>
      Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,<br>
      No marvel; for myself do scarce allow<br>
      The witness of mine eyes. But as I look’d<br>
      Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet<br>
      Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:<br>
      His midmost grasp’d the belly, a forefoot<br>
      Seized on each arm (while deep in either cheek<br>
      He flesh’d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs<br>
      Were spread, ’twixt which the tail inserted curl’d<br>
      Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne’er clasp’d<br>
      A <span class="tooltip">dodder<span class="tooltiptext">(of a tree) having lost most of its branches owing to decay or age.</span></span>’d oak, as round the other’s limbs<br>
      The hideous monster intertwined his own.<br>
      Then, as they both had been of burning wax,<br>
      Each melted into other, mingling hues,<br>
      That which was either now was seen no more.<br>
      Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,<br>
      A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,<br>
      And the clean white expires. The other two<br>
      Look’d on exclaiming, “Ah! how dost thou change,<br>
      Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,<br>
      Nor only one.” The two heads now became<br>
      One, and two figures blended in one form<br>
      Appear’d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths<br>
      Two arms were made: the belly and the chest,<br>
      The thighs and legs, into such members changed<br>
      As never eye hath seen. Of former shape<br>
      All trace was vanish’d. Two, yet neither, seem’d<br>
      That image miscreate, and so pass’d on<br>
      With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge<br>
      Of the fierce dog-star that lays bare the fields,<br>
      Shifting from brake to brake the lizard seems<br>
      A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road;<br>
      So toward the entrails of the other two<br>
      Approaching seem’d an adder all on fire,<br>
      As the dark pepper-grain livid and swart.<br>
      In that part, whence our life is nourish’d first,<br>
      Once he transpierced; then down before him fell<br>
      Stretch’d out. The pierced spirit look’d on him,<br>
      But spake not; yea, stood motionless and yawn’d,<br>
      As if by sleep or feverous fit assail’d.<br>
      He eyed the serpent, and the serpent him.<br>
      One from the wound, the other from the mouth<br>
      Breathed a thick smoke, whose vapory columns join’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lucan in mute attention now may hear,<br>
      Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus, tell,<br>
      Nor thine, Nasidius. Ovid now be mute.<br>
      What if in warbling fiction he record<br>
      Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake<br>
      Him changed, and her into a fountain clear,<br>
      I envy not; for never face to face<br>
      Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,<br>
      Wherein both shapes were ready to assume<br>
      The other’s substance. They in mutual guise<br>
      So answer’d that the serpent split his train<br>
      Divided to a fork, and the pierced spirit<br>
      Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs<br>
      Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon<br>
      Was visible: the tail, disparted, took<br>
      The figure which the spirit lost; its skin<br>
      Softening, his <span class="tooltip">indurated<span class="tooltiptext">hardened</span></span> to a rind.<br>
      The shoulders next I mark’d, that entering join’d<br>
      The monster’s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet<br>
      So lengthen’d, as the others dwindling shrunk.<br>
      The feet behind then twisting up became<br>
      That part that man conceals, which in the wretch<br>
      Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke<br>
      With a new color veils, and generates<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">excrescent<span class="tooltiptext">growing abnormally out of something else; superfluous.</span></span> pile on one, peeling it off<br>
      From the other body, lo! upon his feet<br>
      One upright rose, and prone the other fell.<br>
      Nor yet their glaring and malignant lamps<br>
      Were shifted, though each feature changed beneath.<br>
      Of him who stood erect, the mounting face<br>
      Retreated toward the temples, and what there<br>
      Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears<br>
      From the smooth cheeks; the rest, not backward dragg’d,<br>
      Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell’d<br>
      Into due size protuberant the lips.<br>
      He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends<br>
      His sharpen’d visage, and draws down the ears<br>
      Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.<br>
      His tongue, continuous before and apt<br>
      For utterance, severs; and the other’s fork<br>
      Closing unites. That done, the smoke was laid.<br>
      The soul, transform’d into the brute, glides off,<br>
      Hissing along the vale, and after him<br>
      The other talking sputters; but soon turn’d<br>
      His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few<br>
      Thus to another spake: “Along this path<br>
      Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        So saw I fluctuate in successive change<br>
      The unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:<br>
      And here if aught my pen have swerved, events<br>
      So strange may be its warrant. O’er mine eyes<br>
      Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet ’scaped they not so covertly, but well<br>
      I mark’d Sciancato: he alone it was<br>
      Of the three first that came, who changed not: tho’<br>
      The other’s fate, Gaville! still dost rue.
      </p>

      <h2>Canto XXVI</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—Remounting by the steps, down which they have descended to the seventh gulf, they go forward to the arch that stretches over the eighth, and from thence behold numberless flames wherein are punished the evil counsellors, each flame containing a sinner, save one, in which were Diomede and Ulysses, the latter of whom relates the manner of his death.
      </p>

      <p>
        FLORENCE, exult! for thou so mightily<br>
        Hast thriven, that o’er land and sea thy wings<br>
        Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell.<br>
        Among the plunderers, such the three I found<br>
        Thy citizens; whence shame to me thy son,<br>
        And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,<br>
      Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long<br>
      Shalt feel what Prato (not to say the rest)<br>
      Would <span class="tooltip">fain<span class="tooltiptext">with pleasure; gladly.</span></span> might come upon thee; and that chance<br>
      Were in good time, if it befell thee now.<br>
      Would so it were, since it must needs befall!<br>
      For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.
      </p>

      <p>
        We from the depth departed; and my guide<br>
      Remounting scaled the flinty steps, which late<br>
      We downward traced, and drew me up the steep.<br>
      Pursuing thus our solitary way<br>
      Among the crags and splinters of the rock,<br>
      Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then sorrow seized me, which e’en now revives,<br>
      As my thought turns again to what I saw,<br>
      And, more than I am <span class="tooltip">wont<span class="tooltiptext">(of a person) in the habit of doing something; accustomed.</span></span>, I rein and curb<br>
      The powers of nature in me, lest they run<br>
      Where Virtue guides not; that, if aught of good<br>
      My gentle star or something better gave me,<br>
      I envy not myself the precious <span class="tooltip">boon<span class="tooltiptext">a thing that is helpful or beneficial.</span></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As in that season, when the sun least veils<br>
      His face that lightens all, what time the fly<br>
      Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then,<br>
      Upon some cliff reclined, beneath him sees<br>
      Fire-flies innumerous spangling o’er the vale,<br>
      Vineyard or <span class="tooltip">tilth<span class="tooltiptext">cultivation of land; tillage.</span></span>, where his day-labor lies;<br>
      With flames so numberless throughout its space<br>
      Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth<br>
      Was to my view exposed. As he, whose wrongs<br>
      The bears avenged, as its departure saw<br>
      Elijah’s chariot, when the steeds erect<br>
      Raised their steep flight for heaven; his eyes meanwhile,<br>
      Straining pursued them, till the flame alone,<br>
      Upsoaring like a misty speck, he <span class="tooltip">kenn’d<span class="tooltiptext">saw; recognized</span></span>:<br>
      E’en thus along the gulf moves every flame,<br>
      A sinner so enfolded close in each,<br>
      That none exhibits token of the theft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon the bridge I forward bent to look<br>
      And grasp’d a flinty mass, or else had fallen,<br>
      Though push’d not from the height. The guide, who mark’d<br>
      How I did gaze attentive, thus began:<br>
      “Within these ardours are the spirits; each<br>
      Swatched in confining fire.” “Master! thy word,”<br>
      I answer’d, “hath assured me; yet I deem’d<br>
      Already of the truth, already wish’d<br>
      To ask thee who is in yon fire, that comes<br>
      So parted at the summit, as it seem’d<br>
      Ascending from that funeral pile where lay<br>
      The Theban brothers.” He replied: “Within,<br>
      Ulysses there and Diomede endure<br>
      Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now<br>
      Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath<br>
      These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore<br>
      The ambush of the horse, that open’d wide<br>
      A portal for the goodly seed to pass,<br>
      Which sow’d imperial Rome; nor less the guile<br>
      Lament they, whence, of her Achilles ’reft,<br>
      Deidamia yet in death complains.<br>
      And there is rued the stratagem that Troy<br>
      Of her <span class="tooltip">Palladium<span class="tooltiptext">a statue of Pallas whose preservation was believed to ensure the safety of Troy</span></span> spoil’d.”—“If they have power<br>
      Of utterance from within these sparks,” said I,<br>
      “O master! think my prayer a thousand-fold<br>
      In repetition urged, that thou vouchsafe<br>
      To pause till here the horned flame arrive.<br>
      See, how toward it with desires I bend.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He thus: “Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,<br>
      And I accept it therefore; but do thou<br>
      Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine;<br>
      For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,<br>
      For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When there the flame had come, where time and place<br>
      Seem’d fitting to my guide, he thus began:<br>
      “O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!<br>
      If, living, I of you did merit aught,<br>
      Whate’er the measure were of that desert,<br>
      When in the world my lofty strain I pour’d,<br>
      Move ye not on, till one of you unfold<br>
      In what clime death o’ertook him self-destroy’d.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn<br>
      Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire<br>
      That labors with the wind, then to and fro<br>
      Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,<br>
      Threw out its voice, and spake: “When I escaped<br>
      From Circe, who beyond a circling year<br>
      Had held me near <span class="tooltip">Caieta<span class="tooltiptext">In Roman mythology, Caieta was the wet-nurse of Aeneas.</span></span> by her charms,<br>
      Ere thus Æneas yet had named the shore;<br>
      Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br>
      Of my old father, nor return of love,<br>
      That should have crown’d Penelope with joy,<br>
      Could overcome in me the zeal I had<br>
      To explore the world, and search the ways of life,<br>
      Man’s evil and his virtue. Forth I sail’d<br>
      Into the deep illimitable main,<br>
      With but one bark, and the small faithful band<br>
      That yet cleaved to me. As Iberia far,<br>
      Far as Marocco, either shore I saw,<br>
      And the Sardinian and each isle beside<br>
      Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age<br>
      Were I and my companions, when we came<br>
      To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain’d<br>
      The boundaries not to be o’erstepp’d by man.<br>
      The walls of Seville to my right I left,<br>
      On the other hand already Ceuta past.<br>
      ‘O brothers!’ I began, ‘who to the west<br>
      Through perils without number now have reach’d;<br>
      To this the short remaining watch, that yet<br>
      Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof<br>
      Of the unpeopled world, following the track<br>
      Of Phœbus. Call to mind from whence ye sprang:<br>
      Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes,<br>
      But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.’<br>
      With these few words I sharpen’d for the voyage<br>
      The mind of my associates, that I then<br>
      Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn<br>
      Our poop we turn’d, and for the witless flight<br>
      Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.<br>
      Each star of the other pole night now beheld,<br>
      And ours so low, that from the ocean floor<br>
      It rose not. Five times reillumed, as oft<br>
      Vanish’d the light from underneath the moon,<br>
      Since the deep way we enter’d, when from far<br>
      Appear’d a mountain dim, loftiest methought<br>
      Of all I e’er beheld. Joy seized us straight;<br>
      But soon to mourning changed. From the new land<br>
      A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side<br>
      Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl’d her round<br>
      With all the waves; the fourth time lifted up<br>
      The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:<br>
      And over us the booming billow closed.”
      </p>

      <h2>Canto XXVII</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—The Poet, treating of the same punishment as in the last Canto, relates that he turned toward a flame in which was the Count Guido da Montefeltro, whose inquiries respecting the state of Romagna he answers; and Guido is thereby induced to declare who he is, and why condemned to that torment.
      </p>

      <p>
        NOW upward rose the flame, and still’d its light<br>
        To speak no more, and now pass’d on with leave<br>
        From the mild poet gain’d; when following came<br>
        Another, from whose top a sound confused,<br>
        Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully<br>
      His cries first echoed who had shaped its mould,<br>
      Did so rebellow, with the voice of him<br>
      Tormented, that the brazen monster seem’d<br>
      Pierced through with pain; thus, while no way they found,<br>
      Nor avenue immediate through the flame,<br>
      Into its language turn’d the dismal words:<br>
      But soon as they had won their passage forth,<br>
      Up from the point, which vibrating obey’d<br>
      Their motion at the tongue, these sounds were heard:<br>
      “O thou! to whom I now direct my voice,<br>
      That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,<br>
      ‘Depart thou; I solicit thee no more;’<br>
      Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive,<br>
      Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,<br>
      And with me parley: lo! it irks not me,<br>
      And yet I burn. If but e’en now thou fall<br>
      Into this blind world, from that pleasant land<br>
      Of <span class="tooltip">Latium<span class="tooltiptext">Latium is the region of central western Italy and the entirety of Vatican City in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians.</span></span>, whence I draw my sum of guilt,<br>
      Tell me if those who in Romagna dwell<br>
      Have peace or war. For of the mountains there<br>
      Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height<br>
      Whence Tiber first unlocks his mighty flood.”

      <p>
        Leaning I listen’d yet with heedful ear,<br>
      When, as he touch’d my side, the leader thus:<br>
      “Speak thou: he is a Latian.” My reply<br>
      Was ready, and I spake without delay:<br>
      “O spirit! who art hidden here below,<br>
      Never was thy Romagna without war<br>
      In her proud tyrants’ bosoms, nor is now:<br>
      But open war there left I none. The state,<br>
      Ravenna hath maintain’d this many a year,<br>
      Is steadfast. There Polenta’s eagle broods;<br>
      And in his broad circumference of plume<br>
      O’ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp<br>
      The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long<br>
      And piled in bloody heap the host of France.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The old mastiff of Verrucchio and the young,<br>
      That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,<br>
      Where they are wont, an <span class="tooltip">augre<span class="tooltiptext">auger; a tool for boring holes</span></span> of their fangs.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lamone’s city, and Santerno’s, range<br>
      Under the lion of the snowy lair,<br>
      Inconstant partisan, that changeth sides,<br>
      Or ever summer yields to winter’s frost.<br>
      And she, whose flank is wash’d of Savio’s wave,<br>
      As ’twixt the level and the steep she lies,<br>
      Lives so ’twixt tyrant power and liberty.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou:<br>
      Be not more hard than others. In the world,<br>
      So may thy name still rear its forehead high.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then roar’d awhile the fire, its sharpen’d point<br>
      On either side waved, and thus breathed at last:<br>
      “If I did think my answer were to one<br>
      Who ever could return unto the world,<br>
      This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne’er,<br>
      If true be told me, any from this depth<br>
      Has found his upward way, I answer thee,<br>
      Nor fear lest infamy record the words.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A man of arms at first, I clothed me then<br>
      In good Saint Francis’ girdle, hoping so<br>
      To have made amends. And certainly my hope<br>
      Had fail’d not, but that he, whom curses light on,<br>
      The high priest, again seduced me into sin.<br>
      And how, and wherefore, listen while I tell.<br>
      Long as this spirit moved the bones and pulp<br>
      My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake<br>
      The nature of the lion than the fox.<br>
      All ways of winding subtlety I knew,<br>
      And with such art conducted, that the sound<br>
      Reach’d the world’s limit. Soon as to that part<br>
      Of life I found me come, and when each behoves<br>
      To lower sails and gather in the lines;<br>
      That, which before had pleased me, then I rued,<br>
      And to repentance and confession turn’d,<br>
      Wretch that I was; and well it had bestead me.<br>
      The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,<br>
      Waging his warfare near the Lateran,<br>
      Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes<br>
      All Christians were, nor against Acre one<br>
      Had fought, nor traffick’d in the <span class="tooltip">Soldan<span class="tooltiptext">Sultan; the ruler of an Islamic country.</span></span>’s land),<br>
      He, his great charge nor sacred ministry,<br>
      In himself reverenced, nor in me that cord<br>
      Which used to mark with leanness whom it girded.<br>
      As in Soracte, Constantine besought,<br>
      To cure his leprosy, Sylvester’s aid;<br>
      So me, to cure the fever of his pride,<br>
      This man besought: my counsel to that end<br>
      He ask’d; and I was silent; for his words<br>
      Seem’d drunken: but forthwith he thus resumed:<br>
      ‘From thy heart banish fear: of all offence<br>
      I hitherto absolve thee. In return,<br>
      Teach me my purpose so to execute,<br>
      That Penestrino cumber earth no more.<br>
      Heaven, as thou knowest, I have power to shut<br>
      And open: and the keys are therefore twain,<br>
      The which my predecessor meanly prized.’
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,<br>
      Of silence, as more perilous I deem’d,<br>
      And answer’d: ‘Father! since thou washest me<br>
      Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,<br>
      Large promise with performance scant, be sure,<br>
      Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.’
      </p>

      <p>
        “When I was number’d with the dead, then came<br>
      Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark<br>
      He met, who cried, ‘Wrong me not; he is mine,<br>
      And must below to join the wretched crew,<br>
      For the deceitful counsel which he gave.<br>
      E’er since I watch’d him, hovering at his hair.<br>
      No power can the <span class="tooltip">impenitent<span class="tooltiptext">not feeling shame or regret about one's actions or attitudes.</span></span> absolve;<br>
      Nor to repent, and will, at once consist,<br>
      By contradiction absolute forbid.’<br>
      Oh misery! how I shook myself, when he<br>
      Seized me, and cried, “Thou haply thought’st me not<br>
      A disputant in logic so exact!’<br>
      To Minos down he bore me; and the judge<br>
      Twined eight times round his callous back the tail,<br>
      Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:<br>
      ‘This is a guilty soul, that in the fire<br>
      Must vanish.’ Hence, <span class="tooltip">perdition<span class="tooltiptext">(in Christian theology) a state of eternal punishment and damnation into which a sinful and unpenitent person passes after death.</span></span>-doom’d, I rove<br>
      A prey to <span class="tooltip">rankling<span class="tooltiptext">(of unpleasant feelings, experiences, etc.) to continue to cause keen irritation or bitter resentment within the mind; fester; be painful.</span></span> sorrow, in this garb.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had thus fulfill’d his words, the flame<br>
      In <span class="tooltip">dolour<span class="tooltiptext">a state of great sorrow or distress.</span></span> parted, beating to and fro,<br>
      And writhing its sharp horn. We onward went,<br>
      I and my leader, up along the rock,<br>
      Far as another arch, that overhangs<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">foss<span class="tooltiptext">ditch; moat</span></span>, wherein the penalty is paid<br>
      Of those who load them with committed sin.
