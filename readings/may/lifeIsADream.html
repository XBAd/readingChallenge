      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene I</h2>

      <p>
        <em>
          A pass of rocks, over which a storm is rolling away, and the sun setting: in the foreground, half-way down, a fortress.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          Enter first from the topmost rock ROSAURA, as from horseback, in man’s attire; and, after her, FIFE
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Rosaura</em>
        THERE, four-footed Fury, blast-engender’d brute, without the wit <br>
        Of brute, or mouth to match the bit<br>
        Of man—art satisfied at last?<br>
        Who, when thunder roll’d aloof,<br>
        Tow’rd the spheres of fire your ears<br>
        Pricking, and the granite kicking<br>
        Into lightning with your hoof,<br>
        Among the tempest-shatter’d crags<br>
        Shattering your luckless rider<br>
        Back into the tempest pass’d?<br>
        There then lie to starve and die,<br>
        Or find another Phaeton<br>
        Mad-mettled as yourself; for I,<br>
        Wearied, worried, and for-done,<br>
        Alone will down the mountain try,<br>
        That knits his brows against the sun.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE  (as to his mule).</em> There, thou mis-begotten thing,<br>
      Long-ear’d lightning, tail’d tornado,<br>
      Griffin-hoof-in hurricano,—<br>
      (I might swear till I were almost<br>
      Hoarse with roaring Asonante)<br>
      Who forsooth because our betters<br>
      Would begin to kick and fling—<br>
      You forthwith your noble mind<br>
      Must prove, and kick me off behind,<br>
      Tow’rd the very centre whither<br>
      Gravity was most inclined.<br>
      There where you have made your bed<br>
      In it lie; for, wet or dry,<br>
      Let what will for me betide you,<br>
      Burning, blowing, freezing, hailing;<br>
      Famine waste you: devil ride you:<br>
      Tempest baste you black and blue:—<br>
        <em>(To ROSAURA.)</em> There! I think in downright railing<br>
      I can hold my own with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Ah, my good Fife, whose merry loyal pipe,<br>
      Come weal, come woe, is never out of tune—<br>
      What, you in the same plight too?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Ay;<br>
      And madam—sir—hereby desire,<br>
      When you your own adventures sing<br>
      Another time in lofty rhyme,<br>
      You don’t forget the trusty squire<br>
      Who went with you Don-quixoting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Well, my good fellow—to leave Pegasus<br>
      Who scarce can serve us than our horses worse—<br>
      They say no one should rob another of<br>
      The single satisfaction he has left<br>
      Of singing his own sorrows; one so great,<br>
      So says some great philosopher, that trouble<br>
      Were worth encount’ring only for the sake<br>
      Of weeping over—what perhaps you know<br>
      Some poet calls the ‘luxury of woe.’
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Had I the poet or philosopher<br>
      In the place of her that kick’d me off to ride,<br>
      I’d test his theory upon his hide.<br>
      But no bones broken, madam—sir, I mean?—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  A scratch here that a handkerchief will heal—<br>
      And you?—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        A scratch in quiddity, or kind:<br>
      But not in ‘quo’—my wounds are all behind.<br>
      But, as you say, to stop this strain,<br>
      Which, somehow, once one’s in the vein,<br>
      Comes clattering after—there again!—<br>
      What are we twain—deuce take’t!—we two,<br>
      I mean, to do—drench’d through and through—<br>
      Oh, I shall choke of rhymes, which I believe<br>
      Are all that we shall have to live on here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  What, is our victual gone too?—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Ay, that brute<br>
      Has carried all we had away with her,<br>
      Clothing, and cate, and all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        And now the sun,<br>
      Our only friend and guide, about to sink<br>
      Under the stage of earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        And enter Night,<br>
      With Capa y Espada—and—pray heaven!—<br>
      With but her lanthorn also.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Ah, I doubt<br>
      To-night, if any, with a dark one—or<br>
      Almost burnt out after a month’s consumption.<br>
      Well! well or ill, on horseback or afoot,<br>
      This is the gate that lets me into Poland;<br>
      And, sorry welcome as she gives a guest<br>
      Who writes his own arrival on her rocks<br>
      In his own blood—<br>
      Yet better on her stony threshold die,<br>
      Than live on unrevenged in Muscovy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Oh, what a soul some women have—I mean<br>
      Some men—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Oh, Fife, Fife, as you love me, Fife,<br>
      Make yourself perfect in that little part,<br>
      Or all will go to ruin!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Oh, I will,<br>
      Please God we find some one to try it on.<br>
      But, truly, would not any one believe<br>
      Some fairy had exchanged us as we lay<br>
      Two tiny foster-children in one cradle?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Well, be that as it may, Fife, it reminds me<br>
      Of what perhaps I should have thought before,<br>
      But better late than never—You know I love you,<br>
      As you, I know, love me, and loyally<br>
      Have follow’d me thus far in my wild venture.<br>
      Well! now then—having seen me safe thus far—<br>
      Safe if not wholly sound—over the rocks<br>
      Into the country where my business lies—<br>
      Why should not you return the way we came,<br>
      The storm all clear’d away, and, leaving me<br>
      (Who now shall want you, though not thank you, less,<br>
      Now that our horses gone) this side the ridge,<br>
      Find your way back to dear old home again;<br>
      While I—Come, come!—<br>
      What, weeping my poor fellow?—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Leave you here<br>
      Alone—my Lady—Lord! I mean my Lord—<br>
      In a strange country—among savages—<br>
      Oh, now I know—you would be rid of me<br>
      For fear my stumbling speech—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Oh, no, no, no!—<br>
      I want you with me for a thousand sakes<br>
      To which that is as nothing—I myself<br>
      More apt to let the secret out myself<br>
      Without your help at all—Come, come, cheer up!<br>
      And if you sing again, ‘Come weal, come woe,’<br>
      Let it be that; for we will never part<br>
      Until you give the signal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        ’Tis a bargain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Now to begin, then. ‘Follow, follow me,<br>
      ‘You fairy elves that be.’
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Ay, and go on—<br>
      Something of ‘following darkness like a dream,’<br>
      For that we’re after.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        No, after the sun;<br>
      Trying to catch hold of his glittering skirts<br>
      That hang upon the mountain as he goes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Ah, he’s himself past catching—as you spoke<br>
      He heard what you were saying, and—just so—<br>
      Like some scared water-bird,<br>
      As we say in my country, dove below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Well, we must follow him as best we may<br>
      Poland is no great country, and, as rich<br>
      In men and means, will but few acres spare<br>
      To lie beneath her barrier mountains bare.<br>
      We cannot, I believe, be very far<br>
      From mankind or their dwellings.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Send it so!<br>
      And well provided for man, woman, and beast.<br>
      No, not for beast. Ah, but my heart begins<br>
      To yearn for her—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Keep close, and keep your feet<br>
      From serving you as hers did.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        As for beasts,<br>
      If in default of other entertainment,<br>
      We should provide them with ourselves to eat—<br>
      Bears, lions, wolves—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Oh, never fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Or else<br>
      Default of other beasts, beastlier men,<br>
      Cannibals, Anthropophagi, bare Poles<br>
      Who never knew a tailor but by taste.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Look, look! Unless my fancy misconceive<br>
      With twilight—down among the rocks there, Fife—<br>
      Some human dwelling, surely—<br>
      Or think you but a rock torn from the rocks<br>
      In some convulsion like to-day’s, and perch’d<br>
      Quaintly among them in mock-masonry?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Most likely that, I doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        No, no—for look!<br>
      A square of darkness opening in it—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Oh,<br>
      I don’t half like such openings!—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Like the loom<br>
      Of night from which she spins her outer gloom—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Lord, Madam, pray forbear this tragic vein<br>
      In such a time and place—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        And now again<br>
      Within that square of darkness, look! a light<br>
      That feels its way with hesitating pulse,<br>
      As we do, through the darkness that it drives<br>
      To blacken into deeper night beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  In which could we follow that light’s example,<br>
      As might some English Bardolph with his nose,<br>
      We might defy the sunset—Hark, a chain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  And now a lamp, a lamp! And now the hand<br>
      That carries it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Oh, Lord! that dreadful chain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  And now the bearer of the lamp; indeed<br>
      As strange as any in Arabian tale,<br>
      So giant-like, and terrible, and grand,<br>
      Spite of the skin he’s wrapt in.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Why, ’tis his own:<br>
      Oh, ’tis some wild man of the woods; I’ve heard<br>
      They build and carry torches—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Never Ape<br>
      Bore such a brow before the heavens as that—<br>
      Chain’d as you say too!—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Oh, that dreadful chain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        And now he sets the lamp down by his side,<br>
      And with one hand clench’d in his tangled hair<br>
      And with a sigh as if his heart would break—  [During this SEGISMUND has entered from the fortress, with a torch.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEGISMUND.</em>  Once more the storm has roar’d itself away,<br>
      Splitting the crags of God as it retires;<br>
      But sparing still what it should only blast,<br>
      This guilty piece of human handiwork,<br>
      And all that are within it. Oh, how oft,<br>
      How oft, within or here abroad, have I<br>
      Waited, and in the whisper of my heart<br>
      Pray’d for the slanting hand of heaven to strike<br>
      The blow myself I dared not, out of fear<br>
      Of that Hereafter, worse, they say, than here,<br>
      Plunged headlong in, but, till dismissal waited,<br>
      To wipe at last all sorrow from men’s eyes,<br>
      And make this heavy dispensation clear.<br>
      Thus have I borne till now, and still endure,<br>
      Crouching in sullen impotence day by day,<br>
      Till some such out-burst of the elements<br>
      Like this rouses the sleeping fire within;<br>
      And standing thus upon the threshold of<br>
      Another night about to close the door<br>
      Upon one wretched day to open it<br>
      On one yet wretcheder because one more;—<br>
      Once more, you savage heavens, I ask of you—<br>
      I, looking up to those relentless eyes<br>
      That, now the greater lamp is gone below,<br>
      Begin to muster in the listening skies;<br>
      In all the shining circuits you have gone<br>
      About this theatre of human woe,<br>
      What greater sorrow have you gazed upon<br>
      Than down this narrow chink you witness still;<br>
      And which, did you yourselves not fore-devise,<br>
      You registered for others to fulfil!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  This is some Laureate at a birthday ode;<br>
      No wonder we went rhyming.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Hush! And now<br>
      See, starting to his feet, he strides about<br>
      Far as his tether’d steps—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>        And if the chain<br>
      You help’d to rivet round me did contract<br>
      Since guiltless infancy from guilt in act;<br>
      Of what in aspiration or in thought<br>
      Guilty, but in resentment of the wrong<br>
      That wreaks revenge on wrong I never wrought<br>
      By excommunication from the free<br>
      Inheritance that all created life,<br>
      Beside myself, is born to—from the wings<br>
      That range your own immeasurable blue,<br>
      Down to the poor, mute, scale-imprison’d things,<br>
      That yet are free to wander, glide, and pass<br>
      About that under-sapphire, whereinto<br>
      Yourselves transfusing you yourselves englass!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  What mystery is this?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Why, the man’s mad:<br>
      That’s all the mystery. That’s why he’s chain’d—<br>
      And why—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>    Nor Nature’s guiltless life alone—<br>
      But that which lives on blood and rapine; nay,<br>
      Charter’d with larger liberty to slay<br>
      Their guiltless kind, the tyrants of the air<br>
      Soar zenith-upward with their screaming prey,<br>
      Making pure heaven drop blood upon the stage<br>
      Of under earth, where lion, wolf, and bear,<br>
      And they that on their treacherous velvet wear<br>
      Figure and constellation like your own,<br>
      With their still living slaughter bound away<br>
      Over the barriers of the mountain cage,<br>
      Against which one, blood-guiltless, and endued<br>
      With aspiration and with aptitude<br>
      Transcending other creatures, day by day<br>
      Beats himself mad with unavailing rage!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Why, that must be the meaning of my mule’s<br>
      Rebellion—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Hush!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>        But then if murder be<br>
      The law by which not only conscience-blind<br>
      Creatures, but man too prospers with his kind;<br>
      Who leaving all his guilty fellows free,<br>
      Under your fatal auspice and divine<br>
      Compulsion, leagued in some mysterious ban<br>
      Against one innocent and helpless man,<br>
      Abuse their liberty to murder mine:<br>
      And sworn to silence, like their masters mute<br>
      In heaven, and like them twirling through the mask<br>
      Of darkness, answering to all I ask,<br>
      Point up to them whose work they execute!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Ev’n as I thought, some poor unhappy wretch,<br>
      By man wrong’d, wretched, unrevenged, as I!<br>
      Nay, so much worse than I, as by those chains<br>
      Clipt of the means of self-revenge on those<br>
      Who lay on him what they deserve. And I,<br>
      Who taunted Heaven a little while ago<br>
      With pouring all its wrath upon my head—<br>
      Alas! like him who caught the cast-off husk<br>
      Of what another bragg’d of feeding on,<br>
      Here’s one that from the refuse of my sorrows<br>
      Could gather all the banquet he desires!<br>
      Poor soul, poor soul!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Speak lower—he will hear you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  And if he should, what then? Why, if he would,<br>
      He could not harm me—Nay, and if he could,<br>
      Methinks I’d venture something of a life<br>
      I care so little for—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>  Who’s that? Clotaldo? Who are you, I say,<br>
      That, venturing in these forbidden rocks,<br>
      Have lighted on my miserable life,<br>
      And your own death?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        You would not hurt me, surely?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>  Not I; but those that, iron as the chain<br>
      In which they slay me with a lingering death,<br>
      Will slay you with a sudden—Who are you?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  A stranger from across the mountain there,<br>
      Who, having lost his way in this strange land<br>
      And coming night, drew hither to what seem’d<br>
      A human dwelling hidden in these rocks,<br>
      And where the voice of human sorrow soon<br>
      Told him it was so.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>        Ay? But nearer—nearer—<br>
      That by this smoky supplement of day<br>
      But for a moment I may see who speaks<br>
      So pitifully sweet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Take care! take care!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Alas, poor man, that I, myself so helpless,<br>
      Could better help you than by barren pity,<br>
      And my poor presence—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>        Oh, might that be all!<br>
      But that—a few poor moments—and, alas!<br>
      The very bliss of having, and the dread<br>
      Of losing, under such a penalty<br>
      As every moment’s having runs more near,<br>
      Stifles the very utterance and resource<br>
      They cry for quickest; till from sheer despair<br>
      Of holding thee, methinks myself would tear<br>
      To pieces—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        There, his word’s enough for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>  Oh, think, if you who move about at will,<br>
      And live in sweet communion with your kind,<br>
      After an hour lost in these lonely rocks<br>
      Hunger and thirst after some human voice<br>
      To drink, and human face to feed upon;<br>
      What must one do where all is mute, or harsh,<br>
      And ev’n the naked face of cruelty<br>
      Were better than the mask it works beneath?—<br>
      Across the mountain then! Across the mountain!<br>
      What if the next world which they tell one of<br>
      Be only next across the mountain then,<br>
      Though I must never see it till I die,<br>
      And you one of its angels?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Alas; alas!<br>
      No angel! And the face you think so fair,<br>
      ’Tis but the dismal frame-work of these rocks<br>
      That makes it seem so; and the world I come from—<br>
      Alas, alas, too many faces there<br>
      Are but fair vizors to black hearts below,<br>
      Or only serve to bring the wearer woe!<br>
      But to yourself—If haply the redress<br>
      That I am here upon may help to yours.<br>
      I heard you tax the heavens with ordering,<br>
      And men for executing, what, alas!<br>
      I now behold. But why, and who they are<br>
      Who do, and you who suffer—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.  (pointing upwards).</em>    Ask of them,<br>
      Whom, as to-night, I have so often ask’d,<br>
      And ask’d in vain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        But surely, surely—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>        Hark!<br>
      The trumpet of the watch to shut us in.<br>
      Oh, should they find you!—Quick! Behind the rocks!<br>
      To-morrow—if to-morrow—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  (flinging her sword toward him). Take my sword!
      </p>

      <em>ROSAURA and FIFE hide in the rocks; Enter CLOTALDO</em>

      <p>
        <em>CLOTALDO.</em>
      These stormy days you like to see the last of<br>
      Are but ill opiates, Segismund, I think,<br>
      For night to follow: and to-night you seem<br>
      More than your wont disorder’d. What! A sword!<br>
      Within there!
      </p>

      <em>Enter SOLDIERS with black vizors and torches</em>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        Here’s a pleasant masquerade!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>  Whosever watch this was<br>
      Will have to pay head-reckoning. Meanwhile,<br>
      This weapon had a wearer. Bring him here,<br>
      Alive or dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEG.</em>  Clotaldo! good Clotaldo!—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.  (to Soldiers who enclose Segismund; others searching the rocks).</em>  You know your duty.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SOLDIERS  (bringing in Rosaura and Fife).</em> Here are two of them,<br>
      Whoever more to follow—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>        Who are you,<br>
      That in defiance of know proclamation<br>
      Are found, at night-fall too, about this place?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  Oh, my Lord, she—I mean he—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Silence, Fife,<br>
      And let me speak for both.—Two foreign men,<br>
      To whom your country and its proclamations<br>
      Are equally unknown; and had we known,<br>
      Ourselves not masters of our lawless beasts<br>
      That, terrified by the storm among your rocks,<br>
      Flung us upon them to our cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>        My mule—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>  Foreigners? Of what country?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Muscovy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>  And whither bound?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Hither—if this be Poland;<br>
      But with no ill design on her, and therefore<br>
      Taking it ill that we should thus be stop<br>
      Upon her threshold so uncivilly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>  Whither in Poland?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        To the capital.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>  And on what errand?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Set me on the road,<br>
      And you shall be the nearer to my answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.  (aside).</em> So resolute and ready to reply,<br>
      And yet so young—and— (Aloud.) Well,—<br>
      Your business was not surely with the man<br>
      We found you with?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        He was the first we saw,—<br>
      And strangers and benighted, as we were,<br>
      As you too would have done in a like case,<br>
      Accosted him at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>        Ay, but this sword?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  I flung it toward him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>        Well, and why?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        And why?<br>
      But to revenge himself on those who thus<br>
      Injuriously misuse him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>        So—so—so!<br>
      ’Tis well such resolution wants a beard—<br>
      And, I suppose, is never to attain one.<br>
      Well, I must take you both, you and your sword,<br>
      Prisoners.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIFE.</em>  (offering a cudgel). Pray take mine, and welcome, sir;<br>
      I’m sure I gave it to that mule of mine<br>
      To mighty little purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Mine you have;<br>
      And may it win us some more kindliness<br>
      Than we have met with yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.  (examining the sword).</em> More mystery!<br>
      How came you by this weapon?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        From my father.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>  And do you know whence he?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>        Oh, very well:<br>
      From one of this same Polish realm of yours,<br>
      Who promised a return, should come the chance,<br>
      Of courtesies that he received himself<br>
      In Muscovy, and left this pledge of it—<br>
      Not likely yet, it seems, to be redeem’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.  (aside).</em> Oh, wondrous chance—or wondrous Providence!<br>
      The sword that I myself in Muscovy,<br>
      When these white hairs were black, for keepsake left<br>
      Of obligation for a like return<br>
      To him who saved me wounded as I lay<br>
      Fighting against his country; took me home;<br>
      Tended me like a brother till recover’d,<br>
      Perchance to fight against him once again—<br>
      And now my sword put back into my hand<br>
      By his—if not his son—still, as so seeming,<br>
      By me, as first devoir of gratitude,<br>
      To seem believing, till the wearer’s self<br>
      See fit to drop the ill-dissembling mask.<br>
      (Aloud.)  Well, a strange turn of fortune has arrested<br>
      The sharp and sudden penalty that else<br>
      Had visited your rashness or mischance:<br>
      In part, your tender youth too—pardon me,<br>
      And touch not where your sword is not to answer—<br>
      Commends you to my care; not your life only,<br>
      Else by this misadventure forfeited;<br>
      But ev’n your errand, which, by happy chance,<br>
      Chimes with the very business I am on,<br>
      And calls me to the very point you aim at.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  The capital?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>        Ay, the capital; and ev’n<br>
      That capital of capitals, the Court:<br>
      Where you may plead, and, I may promise, win<br>
      Pardon for this, you say unwilling, trespass,<br>
      And prosecute what else you have at heart,<br>
      With me to help you forward all I can;<br>
      Provided all in loyalty to those<br>
      To whom by natural allegiance<br>
      I first am bound to.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>      As you make, I take<br>
      Your offer: with like promise on my side<br>
      Of loyalty to you and those you serve,<br>
      Under like reservation for regards<br>
      Nearer and dearer still.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>CLO.</em>        Enough, enough;<br>
      Your hand; a bargain on both sides. Meanwhile,<br>
      Here shall you rest to-night. The break of day<br>
      Shall see us both together on the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>ROS.</em>  Thus then what I for misadventure blamed,<br>
      Directly draws me where my wishes aim’d.  [Exeunt.]
