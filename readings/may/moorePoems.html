      <h2>The Light of Other Days</h2>

      <p>
        OFT in the stilly night <br>
          Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,<br>
        Fond Memory brings the light<br>
          Of other days around me:<br>
            The smiles, the tears<br>
            Of boyhood’s years,<br>
          The words of love then spoken;<br>
            The eyes that shone,<br>
            Now dimm’d and gone,<br>
          The cheerful hearts now broken!<br>
        Thus in the stilly night<br>
          Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,<br>
        Sad Memory brings the light<br>
          Of other days around me.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I remember all <br>
          The friends so link’d together <br>
        I’ve seen around me fall<br>
          Like leaves in wintry weather,<br>
            I feel like one<br>
            Who treads alone<br>
          Some banquet-hall deserted,<br>
            Whose lights are fled<br>
            Whose garlands dead,<br>
          And all but he departed!<br>
        Thus in the stilly night<br>
          Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,<br>
        Sad Memory brings the light<br>
          Of other days around me.
      </p>

      <h2>Pro Patria Mori</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN he who adores thee has left but the name<br>
          Of his fault and his sorrows behind,<br>
        O! say wilt thou weep, when they darken the fame<br>
          Of a life that for thee was resign’d!<br>
        Yes, weep, and however my foes may condemn,<br>
          Thy tears shall efface their decree;<br>
        For, Heaven can witness, though guilty to them,<br>
          I have been but too faithful to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        With thee were the dreams of my earliest love;<br>
          Every thought of my reason was thine:<br>
        In my last humble prayer to the Spirit above<br>
          Thy name shall be mingled with mine!<br>
        O! blest are the lovers and friends who shall live<br>
          The days of thy glory to see;<br>
        But the next dearest blessing that Heaven can give<br>
          Is the pride of thus dying for thee.
      </p>

      <h2>The Meeting of the Waters</h2>

      <p>
        THERE is not in the wide world a valley so sweet<br>
        As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet;<br>
        Oh! the last rays of feeling and life must depart,<br>
        Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet it was not that nature had shed o’er the scene<br>
        Her purest of crystal and brightest of green;<br>
        ’Twas not her soft magic of streamlet or hill,<br>
        Oh! no—it was something more exquisite still.
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Twas that friends, the beloved of my bosom, were near,<br>
        Who made every dear scene of enchantment more dear,<br>
        And who felt how the best charms of nature improve,<br>
        When we see them reflected from looks that we love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sweet vale of Avoca! how calm could I rest<br>
        In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I love best,<br>
        Where the storms that we feel in this cold world should cease,<br>
        And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in peace.
      </p>

      <h2>The Last Rose of Summer</h2>

      <p>
        ’TIS the last rose of summer<br>
          Left blooming alone;<br>
        All her lovely companions<br>
          Are faded and gone;<br>
        No flower of her kindred,<br>
          No rosebud is nigh,<br>
        To reflect back her blushes,<br>
          To give sigh for sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll not leave thee, thou lone one!<br>
          To pine on the stem;<br>
        Since the lovely are sleeping,<br>
          Go, sleep thou with them.<br>
        Thus kindly I scatter<br>
          Thy leaves o’er the bed,<br>
        Where thy mates of the garden<br>
          Lie scentless and dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        So soon may I follow,<br>
          When friendships decay,<br>
        And from Love’s shining circle<br>
          The gems drop away.<br>
        When true hearts lie withered<br>
          And fond ones are flown,<br>
        Oh! who would inhabit<br>
          This bleak world alone?
      </p>

      <h2>The Harp that Once Through Tara’s Halls</h2>

      <p>
        THE HARP that once through Tara’s halls<br>
          The soul of music shed,<br>
        Now hangs as mute on Tara’s walls<br>
          As if that soul were fled.<br>
        So sleeps the pride of former days,<br>
          So glory’s thrill is o’er,<br>
        And hearts, that once beat high for praise,<br>
          Now feel that pulse no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        No more to chiefs and ladies bright<br>
          The harp of Tara swells:<br>
        The chord alone, that breaks at night,<br>
          Its tale of ruin tells.<br>
        Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes,<br>
          The only throb she gives,<br>
        Is when some heart indignant breaks,<br>
          To show that still she lives.
      </p>

      <h2>A Canadian Boat-Song</h2>

      <p>
        FAINTLY as tolls the evening chime<br>
        Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time.<br>
        Soon as the woods on shore look dim,<br>
        We’ll sing at St. Anne’s our parting hymn.<br>
        Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,<br>
        The Rapids are near and the daylight’s past!
      </p>

      <p>
        Why should we yet our sail unfurl?<br>
        There is not a breath the blue wave to curl;<br>
        But, when the wind blows off the shore,<br>
        Oh! sweetly we’ll rest our weary oar.<br>
        Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast,<br>
        The Rapids are near and the daylight’s past!
      </p>

      <p>
        Utawas’ tide! this trembling moon<br>
        Shall see us float over thy surges soon.<br>
        Saint of this green isle! hear our prayers,<br>
        Oh, grant us cool heavens and favouring airs.<br>
        Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast,<br>
        The Rapids are near and the daylight’s past!
      </p>

      <h2>The Journey Onwards</h2>

      <p>
        AS slow our ship her foamy track<br>
          Against the wind was cleaving,<br>
        Her trembling pennant still look’d back<br>
          To that dear isle ’twas leaving.<br>
        So loth we part from all we love,<br>
          From all the links that bind us;<br>
        So turn our hearts, as on we rove,<br>
          To those we’ve left behind us!
      </p>

      <p>
        When, round the bowl, of vanish’d years<br>
          We talk with joyous seeming—<br>
        With smiles that might as well be tears,<br>
          So faint, so sad their beaming;<br>
        While memory brings us back again<br>
          Each early tie that twined us,<br>
        O, sweet’s the cup that circles then<br>
          To those we’ve left behind us!
      </p>

      <p>
        And when, in other climes, we meet<br>
          Some isle or vale enchanting,<br>
        Where all looks flowery, wild and sweet,<br>
          And nought but love is wanting;<br>
        We think how great had been our bliss<br>
          If Heaven had but assign’d us<br>
        To live and die in scenes like this,<br>
          With some we’ve left behind us!
      </p>

      <p>
        As travellers oft look back at eve<br>
          When eastward darkly going,<br>
        To gaze upon that light they leave<br>
          Still faint behind them glowing,—<br>
        So, when the close of pleasure’s day<br>
          To gloom hath near consign’d us,<br>
        We turn to catch one fading ray<br>
          Of joy that’s left behind us.
      </p>

      <h2>The Young May Moon</h2>

      <p>
        THE YOUNG May moon is beaming, love,<br>
        The glow-worm’s lamp is gleaming, love;<br>
            How sweet to rove<br>
            Through Morna’s grove,<br>
        When the drowsy world is dreaming, love!<br>
        Then awake!—the heavens look bright, my dear,<br>
        ’Tis never too late for delight, my dear;<br>
            And the best of all ways<br>
            To lengthen our days<br>
        Is to steal a few hours from the night, my dear!
      </p>

      <p>
        Now all the world is sleeping, love,<br>
        But the Sage, his star-watch keeping, love,<br>
            And I, whose star<br>
            More glorious far<br>
        Is the eye from that casement peeping, love.<br>
        Then awake!—till rise of sun, my dear,<br>
        The Sage’s glass we’ll shun, my dear,<br>
            Or in watching the flight<br>
            Of bodies of light<br>
        He might happen to take thee for one, my dear!
      </p>

      <h2>Echo</h2>

      <p>
        HOW sweet the answer Echo makes<br>
        To Music at night<br>
        When, roused by lute or horn, she wakes,<br>
        And far away o’er lawns and lakes<br>
        Goes answering light!
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet Love hath echoes truer far<br>
        And far more sweet<br>
        Than e’er, beneath the moonlight’s star,<br>
        Of horn or lute or soft guitar<br>
        The songs repeat.
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Tis when the sigh,—in youth sincere<br>
        And only then,<br>
        The sigh that’s breathed for one to hear—<br>
        Is by that one, that only dear<br>
        Breathed back again.
      </p>

      <h2>At the Mid Hour of Night</h2>

      <p>
        AT the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping, I fly<br>
        To the lone vale we loved, when life shone warm in thine eye;<br>
        And I think oft, if spirits can steal from the regions of air<br>
        To revisit past scenes of delight, thou wilt come to me there<br>
        And tell me our love is remember’d even in the sky!
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I sing the wild song it once was rapture to hear<br>
        When our voices, commingling, breathed like one on the ear;<br>
        And as Echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls,<br>
        I think, O my Love! ’tis thy voice, from the Kingdom of Souls<br>
        Faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear.
