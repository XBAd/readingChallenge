      <h2>Act IV</h2>

      <h2>Scene II</h2>

      <em>[Enter Madman]</em>

      <p>
        Here by a Madman this song is sung to a dismal kind of music

        <blockquote>
          O, let us howl some heavy note, <br>
            Some deadly dogged howl, <br>
          Sounding as from the threatening throat <br>
            Of beasts and fatal fowl! <br>
          As ravens, screech-owls, bulls, and bears, <br>
            We ’ll bell, and bawl our parts, <br>
          Till irksome noise have cloy’d your ears <br>
            And corrosiv’d your hearts. <br>
          At last, whenas our choir wants breath, <br>
            Our bodies being blest, <br>
          We ’ll sing, like swans, to welcome death, <br>
            And die in love and rest.
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FIRST MADMAN.</em>  Doom’s-day not come yet! I ’ll draw it nearer by a perspective, or make a glass that shall set all the world on fire upon an instant. I cannot sleep; my pillow is stuffed with a litter of porcupines. <br>
        <em>SECOND MADMAN.</em>  Hell is a mere glass-house, where the devils are continually blowing up women’s souls on hollow irons, and the fire never goes out. <br>
        <em>FIRST MADMAN.</em>  I have skill in heraldry. <br>
        <em>SECOND MADMAN.</em>  Hast? <br>
        <em>FIRST MADMAN.</em>  You do give for your crest a woodcock’s head with the brains picked out on ’t; you are a very ancient gentleman. <br>
        <em>THIRD MADMAN.</em>  Greek is turned Turk: we are only to be saved by the Helvetian translation. <br>
        <em>FIRST MADMAN.</em>  Come on, sir, I will lay the law to you. <br>
        <em>SECOND MADMAN.</em>  O, rather lay a corrosive: the law will eat to the bone. <br>
        <em>THIRD MADMAN.</em>  He that drinks but to satisfy nature is damn’d. <br>
        <em>FOURTH MADMAN.</em>  If I had my glass here, I would show a sight should make all the women here call me mad doctor. <br>
        <em>FIRST MADMAN.</em>  What ’s he? a rope-maker? <br>
        <em>SECOND MADMAN.</em>  No, no, no, a snuffling knave that, while he shows the tombs, will have his hand in a wench’s placket. <br>
        <em>THIRD MADMAN.</em>  Woe to the caroche that brought home my wife from the masque at three o’clock in the morning! It had a large feather-bed in it. <br>
        <em>FOURTH MADMAN.</em>  I have pared the devil’s nails forty times, roasted them in raven’s eggs, and cured agues with them. <br>
        <em>THIRD MADMAN.</em>  Get me three hundred milch-bats, to make possets to procure sleep. <br>
        <em>FOURTH MADMAN.</em>  All the college may throw their caps at me: I have made a soap-boiler costive; it was my masterpiece.  Here the dance, consisting of Eight Madmen, with music answerable thereunto; after which, BOSOLA, like an old man, enters. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Is he mad too? <br>
        <em>SERV.</em>        Pray, question him. I ’ll leave you.  [Exeunt Servant and Madmen.] <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  I am come to make thy tomb. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>        Ha! my tomb! <br>
      Thou speak’st as if I lay upon my death-bed, <br>
      Gasping for breath. Dost thou perceive me sick? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Yes, and the more dangerously, since thy sickness is insensible. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Thou art not mad, sure: dost know me? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Yes. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>        Who am I? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Thou art a box of worm-seed, at best but a salvatory of green mummy. What ’s this flesh? a little crudded milk, fantastical puff-paste. Our bodies are weaker than those paper-prisons boys use to keep flies in; more contemptible, since ours is to preserve earth-worms. Didst thou ever see a lark in a cage? Such is the soul in the body: this world is like her little turf of grass, and the heaven o’er our heads like her looking-glass, only gives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Am not I thy duchess? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Thou art some great woman, sure, for riot begins to sit on thy forehead (clad in gray hairs) twenty years sooner than on a merry milk-maid’s. Thou sleepest worse than if a mouse should be forced to take up her lodging in a cat’s ear: a little infant that breeds its teeth, should it lie with thee, would cry out, as if thou wert the more unquiet bedfellow. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  I am Duchess of Malfi still. <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  That makes thy sleep so broken: <br>
      Glories, like glow-worms, afar off shine bright, <br>
      But, look’d to near, have neither heat nor light. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Thou art very plain. <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  My trade is to flatter the dead, not the living; I am a tomb-maker. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  And thou comest to make my tomb? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Yes. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Let me be a little merry:—of what stuff wilt thou make it? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Nay, resolve me first, of what fashion? <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Why, do we grow fantastical on our deathbed? Do we affect fashion in the grave? <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Most ambitiously. Princes’ images on their tombs do not lie, as they were wont, seeming to pray up to heaven; but with their hands under their cheeks, as if they died of the tooth-ache. They are not carved with their eyes fix’d upon the stars, but as their minds were wholly bent upon the world, the selfsame way they seem to turn their faces. <br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Let me know fully therefore the effect <br>
      Of this thy dismal preparation, <br>
      This talk fit for a charnel. <br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Now I shall:—
      </p>

      <em>[Enter Executioners, with] a coffin, cords, and a bell</em>

      <p>
        Here is a present from your princely brothers;<br>
        And may it arrive welcome, for it brings<br>
        Last benefit, last sorrow.<br>
          <em>DUCH.</em>        Let me see it:<br>
        I have so much obedience in my blood,<br>
        I wish it in their veins to do them good.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>  This is your last presence-chamber.<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>  O my sweet lady!<br>
          <em>DUCH.</em>        Peace; it affrights not me.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>  I am the common bellman<br>
        That usually is sent to condemn’d persons<br>
        The night before they suffer.<br>
          <em>DUCH.</em>        Even now thou said’st<br>
        Thou wast a tomb-maker.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>        ’Twas to bring you<br>
        By degrees to mortification. Listen.

        <blockquote>
          Hark, now everything is still,<br>
          The screech-owl and the whistler shrill<br>
          Call upon our dame aloud,<br>
          And bid her quickly don her shroud!<br>
          Much you had of land and rent;<br>
          Your length in clay ’s now competent:<br>
          A long war disturb’d your mind;<br>
          Here your perfect peace is sign’d.<br>
          Of what is ’t fools make such vain keeping?<br>
          Sin their conception, their birth weeping,<br>
          Their life a general mist of error,<br>
          Their death a hideous storm of terror.<br>
          Strew your hair with powders sweet,<br>
          Don clean linen, bathe your feet,<br>
          And (the foul fiend more to check)<br>
          A crucifix let bless your neck.<br>
          ’Tis now full tide ’tween night and day;<br>
          End your groan, and come away.
        </blockquote>

        <em>CARI.</em>  Hence, villains, tyrants, murderers! Alas!<br>
      What will you do with my lady?—Call for help!<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  To whom? To our next neighbours? They are mad-folks.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Remove that noise.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>        Farewell, Cariola.<br>
      In my last will I have not much to give:<br>
      A many hungry guests have fed upon me;<br>
      Thine will be a poor reversion.<br>
        <em>CARI.</em>        I will die with her.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  I pray thee, look thou giv’st my little boy<br>
      Some syrup for his cold, and let the girl<br>
      Say her prayers ere she sleep.  [CARIOLA is forced out by the Executioners.]<br>
              Now what you please:<br>
      What death?<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Strangling; here are your executioners.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  I forgive them:<br>
      The apoplexy, catarrh, or cough o’ th’ lungs,<br>
      Would do as much as they do.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Doth not death fright you?<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>        Who would be afraid on ’t,<br>
      Knowing to meet such excellent company<br>
      In th’ other world?<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Yet, methinks,<br>
      The manner of your death should much afflict you:<br>
      This cord should terrify you.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>        Not a whit:<br>
      What would it pleasure me to have my throat cut<br>
      With diamonds? or to be smothered<br>
      With cassia? or to be shot to death with pearls?<br>
      I know death hath ten thousand several doors<br>
      For men to take their exits; and ’tis found<br>
      They go on such strange geometrical hinges,<br>
      You may open them both ways: any way, for heaven-sake,<br>
      So I were out of your whispering. Tell my brothers<br>
      That I perceive death, now I am well awake,<br>
      Best gift is they can give or I can take.<br>
      I would fain put off my last woman’s-fault,<br>
      I ’d not be tedious to you.<br>
        <em>FIRST EXECUT.</em>        We are ready.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Dispose my breath how please you; but my body<br>
      Bestow upon my women, will you?<br>
        <em>FIRST EXECUT.</em>        Yes.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Pull, and pull strongly, for your able strength<br>
      Must pull down heaven upon me:—<br>
      Yet stay; heaven-gates are not so highly arch’d<br>
      As princes’ palaces; they that enter there<br>
      Must go upon their knees [Kneels].—Come, violent death,<br>
      Serve for mandragora to make me sleep!—<br>
      Go tell my brothers, when I am laid out,<br>
      They then may feed in quiet.  They strangle her.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Where ’s the waiting-woman?<br>
      Fetch her: some other strangle the children.
      </p>

      <em>[Enter CARIOLA]</em>

      <p>
        Look you, there sleeps your mistress.<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>        O, you are damn’d<br>
        Perpetually for this! My turn is next;<br>
        Is ’t not so ordered?<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>        Yes, and I am glad<br>
        You are so well prepar’d for ’t.<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>        You are deceiv’d, sir,<br>
        I am not prepar’d for ’t, I will not die;<br>
        I will first come to my answer, and know<br>
        How I have offended.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>        Come despatch her.—<br>
        You kept her counsel; now you shall keep ours.<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>  I will not die, I must not; I am contracted<br>
        To a young gentleman.<br>
          <em>FIRST EXECUT.</em>        Here ’s your wedding-ring.<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>  Let me but speak with the duke. I ’ll discover<br>
        Treason to his person.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>        Delays:—throttle her.<br>
          <em>FIRST EXECUT.</em>  She bites and scratches.<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>        If you kill me now,<br>
        I am damn’d; I have not been at confession<br>
        This two years.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>  [To EXECUTIONERS.]  When?<br>
          <em>CARI.</em>        I am quick with child.<br>
          <em>BOS.</em>        Why, then,<br>
        Your credit ’s saved.  [Executioners strangle CARIOLA.]<br>
                Bear her into the next room;<br>
        Let these lie still.  [Exeunt the Executioners with the body of CARIOLA.]
      </p>

      <em>[Enter FERDINAND]</em>

      <p>
        <em>FERD.</em>        Is she dead?<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        She is what<br>
      You’d have her. But here begin your pity:  Shows the Children strangled.<br>
      Alas, how have these offended?<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        The death<br>
      Of young wolves is never to be pitied.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Fix your eye here.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        Constantly.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Do you not weep?<br>
      Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out.<br>
      The element of water moistens the earth,<br>
      But blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle: she died young.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  I think not so; her infelicity<br>
      Seem’d to have years too many.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  She and I were twins;<br>
      And should I die this instant, I had liv’d<br>
      Her time to a minute.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        It seems she was born first:<br>
      You have bloodily approv’d the ancient truth,<br>
      That kindred commonly do worse agree<br>
      Than remote strangers.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        Let me see her face<br>
      Again. Why didst thou not pity her? What<br>
      An excellent honest man mightst thou have been,<br>
      If thou hadst borne her to some sanctuary!<br>
      Or, bold in a good cause, oppos’d thyself,<br>
      With thy advanced sword above thy head,<br>
      Between her innocence and my revenge!<br>
      I bade thee, when I was distracted of my wits,<br>
      Go kill my dearest friend, and thou hast done ’t.<br>
      For let me but examine well the cause:<br>
      What was the meanness of her match to me?<br>
      Only I must confess I had a hope,<br>
      Had she continu’d widow, to have gain’d<br>
      An infinite mass of treasure by her death:<br>
      And that was the main cause,—her marriage,<br>
      That drew a stream of gall quite through my heart.<br>
      For thee, as we observe in tragedies<br>
      That a good actor many times is curs’d<br>
      For playing a villain’s part, I hate thee for ’t,<br>
      And, for my sake, say, thou hast done much ill well.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Let me quicken your memory, for I perceive<br>
      You are falling into ingratitude: I challenge<br>
      The reward due to my service.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        I ’ll tell thee<br>
      What I ’ll give thee.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Do.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        I ’ll give thee a pardon<br>
      For this murder.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Ha!<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        Yes, and ’tis<br>
      The largest bounty I can study to do thee.<br>
      By what authority didst thou execute<br>
      This bloody sentence?<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        By yours.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Mine! was I her judge?<br>
      Did any ceremonial form of law<br>
      Doom her to not-being? Did a complete jury<br>
      Deliver her conviction up i’ the court?<br>
      Where shalt thou find this judgment register’d,<br>
      Unless in hell? See, like a bloody fool,<br>
      Thou’st forfeited thy life, and thou shalt die for ’t.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  The office of justice is perverted quite<br>
      When one thief hangs another. Who shall dare<br>
      To reveal this?<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        O, I ’ll tell thee;<br>
      The wolf shall find her grave, and scrape it up,<br>
      Not to devour the corpse, but to discover<br>
      The horrid murder.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        You, not I, shall quake for ’t.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Leave me.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        I will first receive my pension.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  You are a villain.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        When your ingratitude<br>
      Is judge, I am so.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        O horror,<br>
      That not the fear of him which binds the devils<br>
      Can prescribe man obedience!—<br>
      Never look upon me more.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Why, fare thee well.<br>
      Your brother and yourself are worthy men!<br>
      You have a pair of hearts are hollow graves,<br>
      Rotten, and rotting others; and your vengeance,<br>
      Like two chain’d-bullets, still goes arm in arm:<br>
      You may be brothers; for treason, like the plague,<br>
      Doth take much in a blood. I stand like one<br>
      That long hath ta’en a sweet and golden dream:<br>
      I am angry with myself, now that I wake.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Get thee into some unknown part o’ the world,<br>
      That I may never see thee.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Let me know<br>
      Wherefore I should be thus neglected. Sir,<br>
      I serv’d your tyranny, and rather strove<br>
      To satisfy yourself than all the world:<br>
      And though I loath’d the evil, yet I lov’d<br>
      You that did counsel it; and rather sought<br>
      To appear a true servant than an honest man.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  I ’ll go hunt the badger by owl-light:<br>
      ’Tis a deed of darkness.  Exit.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  He ’s much distracted. Off, my painted honour!<br>
      While with vain hopes our faculties we tire,<br>
      We seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire.<br>
      What would I do, were this to do again?<br>
      I would not change my peace of conscience<br>
      For all the wealth of Europe.—She stirs; here ’s life:—<br>
      Return, fair soul, from darkness, and lead mine<br>
      Out of this sensible hell:—she ’s warm, she breathes:—<br>
      Upon thy pale lips I will melt my heart,<br>
      To store them with fresh colour.—Who ’s there?<br>
      Some cordial drink!—Alas! I dare not call:<br>
      So pity would destroy pity.—Her eye opes,<br>
      And heaven in it seems to ope, that late was shut,<br>
      To take me up to mercy.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>  Antonio!<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Yes, madam, he is living;<br>
      The dead bodies you saw were but feign’d statues.<br>
      He ’s reconcil’d to your brothers; the Pope hath wrought<br>
      The atonement.<br>
        <em>DUCH.</em>        Mercy!  Dies.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  O, she ’s gone again! there the cords of life broke.<br>
      O sacred innocence, that sweetly sleeps<br>
      On turtles’ feathers, whilst a guilty conscience<br>
      Is a black register wherein is writ<br>
      All our good deeds and bad, a perspective<br>
      That shows us hell! That we cannot be suffer’d<br>
      To do good when we have a mind to it!<br>
      This is manly sorrow;<br>
      These tears, I am very certain, never grew<br>
      In my mother’s milk. My estate is sunk<br>
      Below the degree of fear: where were<br>
      These penitent fountains while she was living?<br>
      O, they were frozen up! Here is a sight<br>
      As direful to my soul as is the sword<br>
      Unto a wretch hath slain his father.<br>
      Come, I ’ll bear thee hence,<br>
      And execute thy last will: that ’s deliver<br>
      Thy body to the reverend dispose<br>
      Of some good women: that the cruel tyrant<br>
      Shall not deny me. Then I ’ll post to Milan,<br>
      Where somewhat I will speedily enact<br>
      Worth my dejection.  Exit [with the body].

      <h2>Act V</h2>

      <h2>Scene I</h2>

      <em>[Enter] ANTONIO and DELIO</em>

      <p>
        <em>ANT.</em>  What think you of my hope of reconcilement<br>
      To the Arragonian brethren?<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>        I misdoubt it;<br>
      For though they have sent their letters of safe-conduct<br>
      For your repair to Milan, they appear<br>
      But nets to entrap you. The Marquis of Pescara,<br>
      Under whom you hold certain land in cheat,<br>
      Much ’gainst his noble nature hath been mov’d<br>
      To seize those lands; and some of his dependants<br>
      Are at this instant making it their suit<br>
      To be invested in your revenues.<br>
      I cannot think they mean well to your life<br>
      That do deprive you of your means of life,<br>
      Your living.<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>        You are still an heretic<br>
      To any safety I can shape myself.<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>  Here comes the marquis: I will make myself<br>
      Petitioner for some part of your land,<br>
      To know whither it is flying.<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>        I pray, do.  [Withdraws.]
      </p>

      <em>[Enter PESCARA]</em>

      <p>
        <em>DELIO.</em>  Sir, I have a suit to you.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        To me?<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>        An easy one:<br>
      There is the Citadel of Saint Bennet,<br>
      With some demesnes, of late in the possession<br>
      Of Antonio Bologna,—please you bestow them on me.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  You are my friend; but this is such a suit,<br>
      Nor fit for me to give, nor you to take.<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>  No, sir?<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        I will give you ample reason for ’t<br>
      Soon in private:—here ’s the cardinal’s mistress.
      </p>

      <em>[Enter JULIA]</em>

      <p>
        <em>JULIA.</em>  My lord, I am grown your poor petitioner,<br>
      And should be an ill beggar, had I not<br>
      A great man’s letter here, the cardinal’s,<br>
      To court you in my favour.  [Gives a letter.]<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        He entreats for you<br>
      The Citadel of Saint Bennet, that belong’d<br>
      To the banish’d Bologna.<br>
        <em>JULIA.</em>        Yes.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  I could not have thought of a friend I could rather<br>
      Pleasure with it: ’tis yours.<br>
        <em>JULIA.</em>        Sir, I thank you;<br>
      And he shall know how doubly I am engag’d<br>
      Both in your gift, and speediness of giving<br>
      Which makes your grant the greater.  Exit.<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>        How they fortify<br>
      Themselves with my ruin!<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>        Sir, I am<br>
      Little bound to you.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        Why?<br>
      Delio. Because you deni’d this suit to me, and gave ’t<br>
      To such a creature.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        Do you know what it was?<br>
      It was Antonio’s land; not forfeited<br>
      By course of law, but ravish’d from his throat<br>
      By the cardinal’s entreaty. It were not fit<br>
      I should bestow so main a piece of wrong<br>
      Upon my friend; ’tis a gratification<br>
      Only due to a strumpet, for it is injustice.<br>
      Shall I sprinkle the pure blood of innocents<br>
      To make those followers I call my friends<br>
      Look ruddier upon me? I am glad<br>
      This land, ta’en from the owner by such wrong,<br>
      Returns again unto so foul an use<br>
      As salary for his lust. Learn, good Delio,<br>
      To ask noble things of me, and you shall find<br>
      I ’ll be a noble giver.<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>        You instruct me well.<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>  Why, here ’s a man now would fright impudence<br>
      From sauciest beggars.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        Prince Ferdinand ’s come to Milan,<br>
      Sick, as they give out, of an apoplexy;<br>
      But some say ’tis a frenzy: I am going<br>
      To visit him.  Exit.<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>        ’Tis a noble old fellow.<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>  What course do you mean to take, Antonio?<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>  This night I mean to venture all my fortune,<br>
      Which is no more than a poor ling’ring life,<br>
      To the cardinal’s worst of malice. I have got<br>
      Private access to his chamber; and intend<br>
      To visit him about the mid of night,<br>
      As once his brother did our noble duchess.<br>
      It may be that the sudden apprehension<br>
      Of danger,—for I ’ll go in mine own shape,—<br>
      When he shall see it fraight with love and duty,<br>
      May draw the poison out of him, and work<br>
      A friendly reconcilement. If it fail,<br>
      Yet it shall rid me of this infamous calling;<br>
      For better fall once than be ever falling.<br>
        <em>DELIO.</em>  I ’ll second you in all danger; and howe’er,<br>
      My life keeps rank with yours.<br>
        <em>ANT.</em>  You are still my lov’d and best friend.  Exeunt.
      </p>

      <h2>Act V</h2>

      <h2>Scene II</h2>

      <em>[Enter] PESCARA and DOCTOR</em>

      <p>
        <em>PES.</em>  Now, doctor, may I visit your patient?<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  If ’t please your lordship; but he ’s instantly<br>
      To take the air here in the gallery<br>
      By my direction.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        Pray thee, what ’s his disease?<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  A very pestilent disease, my lord,<br>
      They call lycanthropia.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        What ’s that?<br>
      I need a dictionary to ’t.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>        I ’ll tell you.<br>
      In those that are possess’d with ’t there o’erflows<br>
      Such melancholy humour they imagine<br>
      Themselves to be transformed into wolves;<br>
      Steal forth to church-yards in the dead of night,<br>
      And dig dead bodies up: as two nights since<br>
      One met the duke ’bout midnight in a lane<br>
      Behind Saint Mark’s church, with the leg of a man<br>
      Upon his shoulder; and he howl’d fearfully;<br>
      Said he was a wolf, only the difference<br>
      Was, a wolf’s skin was hairy on the outside,<br>
      His on the inside; bade them take their swords,<br>
      Rip up his flesh, and try. Straight I was sent for,<br>
      And, having minister’d to him, found his grace<br>
      Very well recover’d.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  I am glad on ’t.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>        Yet not without some fear<br>
      Of a relapse. If he grow to his fit again,<br>
      I ’ll go a nearer way to work with him<br>
      Than ever Paracelsus dream’d of; if<br>
      They ’ll give me leave, I ’ll buffet his madness out of him.<br>
      Stand aside; he comes.
      </p>

      <em>[Enter FERDINAND, CARDINAL, MALATESTI, and BOSOLA]</em>

      <p>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Leave me.<br>
        <em>MAL.</em>  Why doth your lordship love this solitariness?<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Eagles commonly fly alone: they are crows, daws, and starlings that flock together. Look, what ’s that follows me?<br>
        <em>MAL.</em>  Nothing, my lord.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Yes.<br>
        <em>MAL.</em>  ’Tis your shadow.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Stay it; let it not haunt me.<br>
        <em>MAL.</em>  Impossible, if you move, and the sun shine.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  I will throttle it.  [Throws himself down on his shadow.]<br>
        <em>MAL.</em>  O, my lord, you are angry with nothing.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  You are a fool: how is ’t possible I should catch my shadow, unless I fall upon ’t? When I go to hell, I mean to carry a bribe; for, look you, good gifts evermore make way for the worst persons.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  Rise, good my lord.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  I am studying the art of patience.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  ’Tis a noble virtue.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  To drive six snails before me from this town to Moscow; neither use goad nor whip to them, but let them take their own time;—the patient’st man i’ th’ world match me for an experiment:—an I ’ll crawl after like a sheep-biter.<br>
        <em>CARD.</em>  Force him up.  [They raise him.]<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Use me well, you were best. What I have done, I have done: I ’ll confess nothing.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  Now let me come to him.—Are you mad, my lord? are you out of your princely wits?<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>        What ’s he?<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        Your doctor.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Let me have his beard saw’d off, and his eye-brows fil’d more civil.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  I must do mad tricks with him, for that ’s the only way on ’t.—I have brought your grace a salamander’s skin to keep you from sun-burning.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  I have cruel sore eyes.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  The white of a cockatrix’s egg is present remedy.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Let it be a new-laid one, you were best.<br>
      Hide me from him: physicians are like kings,—<br>
      They brook no contradiction.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  Now he begins to fear me: now let me alone with him.<br>
        <em>CARD.</em>  How now! put off your gown!<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  Let me have some forty urinals filled with rosewater: he and I ’ll go pelt one another with them.—Now he begins to fear me.—Can you fetch a frisk, sir?—Let him go, let him go, upon my peril: I find by his eye he stands in awe of me; I ’ll make him as tame as a dormouse.<br>
        <em>FERD.</em>  Can you fetch your frisks, sir!—I will stamp him into a cullis, flay off his skin to cover one of the anatomies this rogue hath set i’ th’ cold yonder in Barber-Chirurgeon’s-hall.—Hence, hence! you are all of you like beasts for sacrifice. [Throws the DOCTOR down and beats him.] There ’s nothing left of you but tongue and belly, flattery and lechery.  [Exit.]<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  Doctor, he did not fear you thoroughly.<br>
        <em>DOC.</em>  True; I was somewhat too forward.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>  Mercy upon me, what a fatal judgment<br>
      Hath fall’n upon this Ferdinand!<br>
        <em>PES.</em>        Knows your grace<br>
      What accident hath brought unto the prince<br>
      This strange distraction?<br>
        <em>CARD.</em>  [aside.]  I must feign somewhat.—Thus they say it grew.<br>
      You have heard it rumour’d, for these many years<br>
      None of our family dies but there is seen<br>
      The shape of an old woman, which is given<br>
      By tradition to us to have been murder’d<br>
      By her nephews for her riches. Such a figure<br>
      One night, as the prince sat up late at ’s book,<br>
      Appear’d to him; when crying out for help,<br>
      The gentleman of ’s chamber found his grace<br>
      All on a cold sweat, alter’d much in face<br>
      And language: since which apparition,<br>
      He hath grown worse and worse, and I much fear<br>
      He cannot live.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Sir, I would speak with you.<br>
        <em>PES.</em>  We ’ll leave your grace,<br>
      Wishing to the sick prince, our noble lord,<br>
      All health of mind and body.<br>
        <em>CARD.</em>        You are most welcome.  [Exeunt PESCARA, MALATESTI, and DOCTOR.]<br>
      Are you come? so.—[Aside.]  This fellow must not know<br>
      By any means I had intelligence<br>
      In our duchess’ death; for, though I counsell’d it,<br>
      The full of all th’ engagement seem’d to grow<br>
      From Ferdinand.—Now, sir, how fares our sister?<br>
      I do not think but sorrow makes her look<br>
      Like to an oft-dy’d garment: she shall now<br>
      Take comfort from me. Why do you look so wildly?<br>
      O, the fortune of your master here the prince<br>
      Dejects you; but be you of happy comfort:<br>
      If you ’ll do one thing for me I ’ll entreat,<br>
      Though he had a cold tomb-stone o’er his bones,<br>
      I ’d make you what you would be.<br>
        <em>BOS.</em>        Any thing;<br>
      Give it me in a breath, and let me fly to ’t.<br>
      They that think long small expedition win,<br>
      For musing much o’ th’ end cannot begin.
