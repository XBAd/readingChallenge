      <h2>The Blessèd Damozel</h2>

      <p>
        THE BLESSÈD Damozel lean’d out <br>
          From the gold bar of Heaven:<br>
        Her blue grave eyes were deeper much<br>
          Than a deep water, even.<br>
        She had three lilies in her hand,<br>
          And the stars in her hair were seven.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,<br>
          No wrought flowers did adorn,<br>
        But a white rose of Mary’s gift<br>
          On the neck meetly worn;<br>
        And her hair, lying down her back,<br>
          Was yellow like ripe corn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Herseem’d she scarce had been a day<br>
          One of God’s choristers;<br>
        The wonder was not yet quite gone<br>
          From that still look of hers;<br>
        Albeit, to them she left, her day<br>
          Had counted as ten years.
      </p>

      <p>
        (To one it is ten years of years:<br>
          … Yet now, here in this place,<br>
        Surely she lean’d o’er me,—her hair<br>
          Fell all about my face…<br>
        Nothing: the Autumn-fall of leaves.<br>
          The whole year sets apace.)
      </p>

      <p>
        It was the terrace of God’s house<br>
          That she was standing on,—<br>
        By God built over the sheer depth<br>
          In which Space is begun;<br>
        So high, that looking downward thence,<br>
          She scarce could see the sun.
      </p>

      <p>
        It lies from Heaven across the flood<br>
          Of ether, as a bridge.<br>
        Beneath, the tides of day and night<br>
          With flame and darkness ridge<br>
        The void, as low as where this earth<br>
          Spins like a fretful midge.
      </p>

      <p>
        But in those tracts, with her, it was<br>
          The peace of utter light<br>
        And silence. For no breeze may stir<br>
          Along the steady flight<br>
        Of seraphim; no echo there,<br>
          Beyond all depth or height.
      </p>

      <p>
        Heard hardly, some of her new friends,<br>
          Playing at holy games,<br>
        Spake, gentle-mouth’d, among themselves,<br>
          Their virginal chaste names;<br>
        And the souls, mounting up to God,<br>
          Went by her like thin flames.
      </p>

      <p>
        And still she bow’d herself, and stoop’d<br>
          Into the vast waste calm;<br>
        Till her bosom’s pressure must have made<br>
          The bar she lean’d on warm,<br>
        And the lilies lay as if asleep<br>
          Along her bended arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw<br>
          Time, like a pulse, shake fierce<br>
        Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove,<br>
          In that steep gulf, to pierce<br>
        The swarm; and then she spoke, as when<br>
          The stars sang in their spheres.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘I wish that he were come to me,<br>
          For he will come,’ she said.<br>
        ‘Have I not pray’d in solemn Heaven?<br>
          On earth, has he not pray’d?<br>
        Are not two prayers a perfect strength?<br>
          And shall I feel afraid?
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘When round his head the aureole clings,<br>
          And he is clothed in white,<br>
        I’ll take his hand, and go with him<br>
          To the deep wells of light,<br>
        And we will step down as to a stream<br>
          And bathe there in God’s sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘We two will stand beside that shrine,<br>
          Occult, withheld, untrod,<br>
        Whose lamps tremble continually<br>
          With prayer sent up to God;<br>
        And where each need, reveal’d, expects<br>
          Its patient period.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘We two will lie i’ the shadow of<br>
          That living mystic tree<br>
        Within whose secret growth the Dove<br>
          Sometimes is felt to be,<br>
        While every leaf that His plumes touch<br>
          Saith His name audibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘And I myself will teach to him,—<br>
          I myself, lying so,—<br>
        The songs I sing here; which his mouth<br>
          Shall pause in, hush’d and slow,<br>
        Finding some knowledge at each pause,<br>
          And some new thing to know.’
      </p>

      <p>
        (Alas! to her wise simple mind<br>
          These things were all but known<br>
        Before: they trembled on her sense,—<br>
          Her voice had caught their tone.<br>
        Alas for lonely Heaven! Alas<br>
          For life wrung out alone!
      </p>

      <p>
        Alas, and though the end were reach’d?…<br>
          Was thy part understood<br>
        Or borne in trust? And for her sake<br>
          Shall this too be found good?—<br>
        May the close lips that knew not prayer<br>
          Praise ever, though they would?)
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘We two,’ she said, ‘will seek the groves<br>
          Where the lady Mary is,<br>
        With her five handmaidens, whose names<br>
          Are five sweet symphonies:—<br>
        Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,<br>
          Margaret and Rosalys.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Circle-wise sit they, with bound locks<br>
          And bosoms coverèd;<br>
        Into the fine cloth, white like flame,<br>
          Weaving the golden thread,<br>
        To fashion the birth-robes for them<br>
          Who are just born, being dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘He shall fear, haply, and be dumb.<br>
          Then I will lay my cheek<br>
        To his, and tell about our love,<br>
          Not once abash’d or weak:<br>
        And the dear Mother will approve<br>
          My pride, and let me speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Herself shall bring us, hand in hand,<br>
          To Him round whom all souls<br>
        Kneel—the unnumber’d solemn heads<br>
          Bow’d with their aureoles:<br>
        And Angels, meeting us, shall sing<br>
          To their citherns and citoles.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘There will I ask of Christ the Lord<br>
          Thus much for him and me:—<br>
        To have more blessing than on earth<br>
          In nowise; but to be<br>
        As then we were,—being as then<br>
          At peace. Yea, verily.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Yea, verily; when he is come<br>
          We will do thus and thus:<br>
        Till this my vigil seem quite strange<br>
          And almost fabulous;<br>
        We two will live at once, one life;<br>
          And peace shall be with us.’
      </p>

      <p>
        She gazed, and listen’d, and then said,<br>
          Less sad of speech than mild,—<br>
        ‘All this is when he comes.’ She ceased:<br>
          The light thrill’d past her, fill’d<br>
        With Angels, in strong level lapse.<br>
          Her eyes pray’d, and she smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        (I saw her smile.) But soon their flight<br>
          Was vague ’mid the poised spheres.<br>
        And then she cast her arms along<br>
          The golden barriers,<br>
        And laid her face between her hands,<br>
          And wept. (I heard her tears.)
      </p>

      <h2>Lovesight</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN do I see thee most, beloved one?<br>
        When in the light the spirits of mine eyes<br>
        Before thy face, their altar, solemnize<br>
        The worship of that Love through thee made known?<br>
        Or when in the dusk hours, (we two alone,)<br>
        Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies<br>
        Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies,<br>
        And my soul only sees thy soul its own?<br>
        O love, my love! if I no more should see<br>
        Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee,<br>
        Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,—<br>
        How then should sound upon Life’s darkening slope<br>
        The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,<br>
        The wind of Death’s imperishable wing?
      </p>

      <h2>Heart’s Hope</h2>

      <p>
        BY what word’s power, the key of paths untrod,<br>
        Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore,<br>
        Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore<br>
        Even as that sea which Israel crossed dryshod?<br>
        For lo! in some poor rhythmic period,<br>
        Lady, I fain would tell how evermore<br>
        Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor<br>
        Thee from myself, neither our love from God.<br>
        Yea, in God’s name, and Love’s, and thine, would I<br>
        Draw from one loving heart such evidence<br>
        As to all hearts all things shall signify;<br>
        Tender as dawn’s first hill-fire, and intense<br>
        As instantaneous penetrating sense,<br>
        In Spring’s birth-hour, of other Springs gone by.
      </p>

      <h2>Genius in Beauty</h2>

      <p>
        BEAUTY like hers is genius. Not the call<br>
        Of Homer’s or of Dante’s heart sublime,—<br>
        Not Michael’s hand furrowing the zones of time,—<br>
        Is more with compassed mysteries musical;<br>
        Nay, not in Spring’s or Summer’s sweet footfall<br>
        More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeathes<br>
        Than doth this sovereign face, whose love-spell breathes<br>
        Even from its shadowed contour on the wall.<br>
        As many men are poets in their youth,<br>
        But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong<br>
        Even through all change the indomitable song;<br>
        So in like wise the envenomed years, whose tooth<br>
        Rends shallower grace with ruin void of ruth,<br>
        Upon this beauty’s power shall wreak no wrong.
      </p>

      <h2>Silent Noon</h2>

      <p>
        YOUR hands lie open in the long, fresh grass,—<br>
        The finger-points look through like rosy blooms:<br>
        Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms<br>
        ’Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass.<br>
        All round our nest, far as the eye can pass,<br>
        Are golden kingcup-fields with silver edge<br>
        Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn hedge.<br>
        ’Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass.<br>
        Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly<br>
        Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky,—<br>
        So this wing’d hour is dropped to us from above.<br>
        Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower,<br>
        This close-companioned inarticulate hour<br>
        When twofold silence was the song of love.
      </p>

      <h2>Love-Sweetness</h2>

      <p>
        SWEET dimness of her loosened hair’s downfall<br>
        About thy face; her sweet hands round thy head<br>
        In gracious fostering union garlanded;<br>
        Her tremulous smiles; her glances’ sweet recall<br>
        Of love; her murmuring sighs memorial;<br>
        Her mouth’s culled sweetness by thy kisses shed<br>
        On cheeks and neck and eyelids, and so led<br>
        Back to her mouth, which answers there for all:—<br>
        What sweeter than these things, except the thing<br>
        In lacking which all these would lose their sweet:—<br>
        The confident heart’s still fervor: the swift beat<br>
        And soft subsidence of the spirit’s wing,<br>
        Then when it feels, in cloud-girt wayfaring,<br>
        The breath of kindred plumes against its feet?
      </p>

      <h2>Heart’s Compass</h2>

      <p>
        SOMETIMES thou seem’st not as thyself alone,<br>
        But as the meaning of all things that are;<br>
        A breathless wonder, shadowing forth afar<br>
        Some heavenly solstice hushed and halcyon;<br>
        Whose unstirred lips are music’s visible tone;<br>
        Whose eyes the sun-gate of the soul unbar,<br>
        Being of its furthest fires oracular—<br>
        The evident heart of all life sown and mown.<br>
        Even such love is; and is not thy name Love?<br>
        Yea, by thy hand the Love-god rends apart<br>
        All gathering clouds of Night’s ambiguous art;<br>
        Flings them far down, and sets thine eyes above;<br>
        And simply, as some gage of flower or glove,<br>
        Stakes with a smile the world against thy heart.
      </p>

      <h2>Her Gifts</h2>

      <p>
        HIGH grace, the dower of queens; and therewithal<br>
        Some wood-born wonder’s sweet simplicity;<br>
        A glance like water brimming with the sky<br>
        Or hyacinth-light where forest-shadows fall;<br>
        Such thrilling pallor of cheek as doth enthral<br>
        The heart; a mouth whose passionate forms imply<br>
        All music and all silence held thereby;<br>
        Deep golden locks, her sovereign coronal;<br>
        A round reared neck, meet column of Love’s shrine<br>
        To cling to when the heart takes sanctuary;<br>
        Hands which for ever at Love’s bidding be,<br>
        And soft-stirred feet still answering to his sign:—<br>
        These are her gifts, as tongue may tell them o’er.
      </p>

      <p>
        Breathe low her name, my soul; for that means more.
