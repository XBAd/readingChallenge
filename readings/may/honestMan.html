      <h2>Epistle IV—Of the Nature and State of Man with Respect to Happiness</h2>

      <p>
        OH Happiness! our being’s end and aim! <br>
        Good, pleasure, ease, content! whate’er thy name:<br>
        That something still which prompts th’ eternal sigh,<br>
        For which we bear to live, or dare to die,<br>
        Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies,<br>
        O’er-look’d, seen double, by the fool, and wise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plant of celestial seed! if dropt below,<br>
        Say, in what mortal soil thou deign’st to grow?<br>
        Fair op’ning to some court’s propitious shine,<br>
        Or deep with di’monds in the flaming mine?<br>
        Twin’d with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,
      </p>

      <p>
        Or reap’d in iron harvests of the field?<br>
      Where grows?—where grows it not? If vain our toil,<br>
      We ought to blame the culture, not the soil:<br>
      Fix’d to no spot is happiness sincere,<br>
      ’Tis nowhere to be found, or ev’rywhere:<br>
      ’Tis never to be bought, but always free,<br>
      And fled from monarchs, St. John! dwells with thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask of the learn’d the way? The learn’d are blind;<br>
      This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind;<br>
      Some place the bliss in action, some in ease,<br>
      Those call it pleasure, and contentment these;<br>
      Some sunk to beasts, find pleasure end in pain;<br>
      Some swell’d to gods, confess e’en virtue vain;<br>
      Or indolent, to each extreme they fall,<br>
      To trust in ev’ry thing, or doubt of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who thus define it, say they more or less<br>
      Than this, that happiness is happiness?
      </p>

      <p>
        Take nature’s path, and mad opinion’s leave;<br>
      All states can reach it, and all heads conceive;<br>
      Obvious her goods, in no extreme they dwell;<br>
      There needs but thinking right, and meaning well;<br>
      And mourn our various portions as we please,<br>
      Equal is common sense, and common ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, man, ‘The universal cause<br>
      Acts not by partial, but by gen’ral laws’;<br>
      And makes what happiness we justly call<br>
      Subsist not in the good of one, but all.<br>
      There’s not a blessing individuals find,<br>
      But some way leans and hearkens to the kind:<br>
      No bandit fierce, no tyrant mad with pride,<br>
      No cavern’d hermit, rests self-satisfy’d:<br>
      Who most to shun or hate mankind pretend,<br>
      Seek an admirer, or who would fix a friend:<br>
      Abstract what others feel, what others think,<br>
      All pleasures sicken, and all glories sink:<br>
      Each has his share; and who would more obtain,<br>
      Shall find the pleasure pays not half the pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Order is heav’n’s first law; and this confest,<br>
      Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,<br>
      More rich, more wise; but who infers from hence<br>
      That such are happier, shocks all common sense.<br>
      Heav’n to mankind impartial we confess,<br>
      If all are equal in their happiness:<br>
      But mutual wants this happiness increase;<br>
      All nature’s diff’rence keeps all nature’s peace.<br>
      Condition, circumstance is not the thing;<br>
      Bliss is the same in subject or in king,<br>
      In who obtain defence, or who defend,<br>
      In him who is, or him who finds a friend:<br>
      Heav’n breathes thro’ ev’ry member of the whole<br>
      One common blessing, as one common soul.<br>
      But fortune’s gifts if each alike possest,<br>
      And each were equal, must not all contest?<br>
      If then to all men happiness was meant,<br>
      God in externals could not place content.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortune her gifts may variously dispose,<br>
      And these be happy call’d, unhappy those;<br>
      But heav’n’s just balance equal will appear,<br>
      While those are plac’d in hope, and these in fear:<br>
      Not present good or ill, the joy or curse,<br>
      But future views of better, or of worse.<br>
      Oh sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,<br>
      By mountains pil’d on mountains, to the skies?<br>
      Heav’n still with laughter the vain toil surveys,<br>
      And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Know, all the good that individuals find,<br>
      Or God and nature meant to mere mankind,<br>
      Reason’s whole pleasure, all the joys of sense,<br>
      Lie in three words, health, peace, and competence<br>
      But health consists with temperance alone;<br>
      And peace, oh virtue! peace is all thy own.<br>
      The good or bad the gifts of fortune gain;<br>
      But these less taste them, as they worse obtain.<br>
      Say, in pursuit of profit or delight,<br>
      Who risk the most, that take wrong means, or right?<br>
      Of vice or virtue, whether blest or curst,<br>
      Which meets contempt, or which compassion first?<br>
      Count all th’ advantage prosp’rous vice attains,<br>
      ’Tis but what virtue flies from and disdains:<br>
      And grant the bad what happiness they would,<br>
      One they must want, which is, to pass for good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh blind to truth, and God’s whole scheme below,<br>
      Who fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe!<br>
      Who sees and follows that great scheme the best,<br>
      Best knows the blessing, and will most be blest.<br>
      But fools the good alone unhappy call,<br>
      For ills or accidents that chance to all.<br>
      See Falkland dies, the virtuous and the just!<br>
      See god-like Turenne prostrate on the dust!<br>
      See Sidney bleeds amid the martial strife!<br>
      Was this their virtue, or contempt of life?<br>
      Say, was it virtue, more tho’ heav’n ne’er gave,<br>
      Lamented Digby! sunk thee to the grave?<br>
      Tell me, if virtue made the son expire,<br>
      Why, full of days and honour, lives the sire?<br>
      Why drew Marseilles’ good bishop purer breath,<br>
      When nature sicken’d and each gale was death!<br>
      Or why so long (in life if long can be)<br>
      Lent heav’n a parent to the poor and me?
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes all physical or moral ill?<br>
      There deviates nature, and here wanders will.<br>
      God sends not ill; if rightly understood,<br>
      Or partial ill is universal good,<br>
      Or change admits, or nature lets it fall,<br>
      Short, and but rare, ’till man improv’d it all.<br>
      We just as wisely might of heav’n complain<br>
      That righteous Abel was destroy’d by Cain,<br>
      As that the virtuous son is ill at ease,<br>
      When his lewd father gave the dire disease.<br>
      Think we, like some weak prince, th’ eternal cause<br>
      Prone for his fav’rites to reverse his laws?
      </p>

      <p>
        Shall burning Ætna, if a sage requires,<br>
      Forget to thunder, and recall her fires?<br>
      On air or sea new motions be imprest,<br>
      Oh blameless Bethel! to relieve thy breast?<br>
      When the loose mountain trembles from on high<br>
      Shall gravitation cease, if you go by?<br>
      Or some old temple, nodding to its fall,<br>
      For Chartres’ head reserve the hanging wall?
      </p>

      <p>
        But still this world (so fitted for the knave)<br>
      Contents us not. A better shall we have?<br>
      A kingdom of the just then let it be:<br>
      But first consider how those just agree.<br>
      The good must merit God’s peculiar care;<br>
      But who, but God, can tell us who they are?<br>
      One thinks on Calvin heav’n’s own spirit fell;<br>
      Another deems him instrument of hell;<br>
      If Calvin feel heav’n’s blessing, or its rod,<br>
      This cries there is, and that, there is no God.<br>
      What shocks one part will edify the rest,<br>
      Nor with one system can they all be blest.<br>
      The very best will variously incline,<br>
      And what rewards your virtue, punish mine.<br>
      Whatever is, is right.—This world, ’tis true,<br>
      Was made for Cæsar—but for Titus too;<br>
      And which more blest, who chain’d his country, say,<br>
      Or he whose virtue sigh’d to lose a day?
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘But sometimes virtue starves, while vice is fed.’<br>
      What then? is the reward of virtue bread?<br>
      That vice may merit, ’tis the price of toil;<br>
      The knave deserves it, when he tills the soil,<br>
      The knave deserves it, when he tempts the main,<br>
      Where folly fights for kings, or dives for gain.<br>
      The good man may be weak, be indolent;<br>
      Nor is his claim to plenty, but content.<br>
      But grant him riches, your demand is o’er?<br>
      ‘No, shall the good want health, the good want pow’r?’<br>
      Add health and pow’r, and ev’ry earthly thing,<br>
      ‘Why bounded pow’r? why private? why no king?<br>
      Nay, why external for internal giv’n?<br>
      Why is not man a God, and earth a heav’n?’<br>
      Who ask and reason thus, will scarce conceive<br>
      God gives enough, while he has more to give:<br>
      Immense the pow’r, immense were the demand;<br>
      Say, at what part of nature will they stand?
      </p>

      <p>
        What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,<br>
      The soul’s calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy,<br>
      Is virtue’s prize: a better would you fix?<br>
      Then give humility a coach and six,<br>
      Justice a conq’ror’s sword, or truth a gown,<br>
      Or public spirit its great cure, a crown.<br>
      Weak, foolish man! will heav’n reward us there<br>
      With the same trash mad mortals wish for here?<br>
      The boy and man an individual makes,<br>
      Yet sigh’st thou now for apples and for cakes?<br>
      Go, like the Indian, in another life<br>
      Expect thy dog, thy bottle, and thy wife,<br>
      As well as dream such trifles are assign’d,<br>
      As toys and empires, for a god-like mind.<br>
      Rewards, that either would to virtue bring<br>
      No joy, or be destructive of the thing:<br>
      How oft by these at sixty are undone<br>
      The virtues of a saint at twenty-one!
      </p>

      <p>
        To whom can riches give repute, or trust,<br>
      Content, or pleasure, but the good and just?<br>
      Judges and senates have been bought for gold,<br>
      Esteem and love were never to be sold.<br>
      Oh fool! to think God hates the worthy mind,<br>
      The lover and the love of human-kind,<br>
      Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear,<br>
      Because he wants a thousand pounds a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Honour and shame from no condition rise;<br>
      Act well your part, there all the honour lies.<br>
      Fortune in men has some small diff’rence mad’<br>
      One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade;<br>
      The cobler apron’d, and the parson gown’d,<br>
      The frier hooded, and the monarch crown’d.<br>
      ‘What differ more (you cry) than crown and cowl?’<br>
      I’ll tell you, friend! a wise man and a fool.<br>
      You’ll find, if once the monarch acts the monk,<br>
      Or, cobler-like, the parson will be drunk,<br>
      Worth makes the man, and want of it, the fellow;<br>
      The rest is all but leather or prunella.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stuck o’er with titles and hung round with strings,<br>
      That thou may’st be by kings, or whores of kings.<br>
      Boast the pure blood of an illustrious race,<br>
      In quiet flow from Lucrece to Lucrece:<br>
      But by your fathers’ worth if your’s you rate,<br>
      Count me those only who were good and great.<br>
      Go! if your ancient, but ignoble blood<br>
      Has crept thro’ scoundrels ever since the flood,<br>
      Go! and pretend your family is young;<br>
      Nor own your fathers have been fools so long.<br>
      What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards?<br>
      Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards,
      </p>

      <p>
        Look next on greatness; say where greatness lies.<br>
      ‘Where, but among the heroes and the wise?’<br>
      Heroes are much the same, the point’s agreed,<br>
      From Macedonia’s madman to the Swede;<br>
      The whole strange purpose of their lives, to find<br>
      Or make, an enemy of all mankind!<br>
      Not one looks backward, onward still he goes,<br>
      Yet ne’er looks forward farther than his nose.<br>
      No less alike the politic and wise;<br>
      All sly slow things, with circumspective eyes:<br>
      Men in their loose unguarded hours they take,<br>
      Not that themselves are wise, but others weak.<br>
      But grant that those can conquer, these can cheat;<br>
      ’Tis phrase absurd to call a villain great:<br>
      Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave,<br>
      Is but the more a fool, the more a knave.<br>
      Who noble ends by noble means obtains,<br>
      Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,<br>
      Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed<br>
      Like Socrates, that man is great indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s fame? a fancy’d life in others’ breath,<br>
      A thing beyond us, ev’n before our death.<br>
      Just what you hear, you have, and what’s unknown<br>
      The same (my lord) if Tully’s, or your own.<br>
      All that we feel of it begins and ends<br>
      In the small circle of our foes or friends;<br>
      To all beside as much an empty shade<br>
      An Eugene living, as a Cæsar dead;<br>
      Alike or when, or where they shone, or shine,<br>
      Or on the Rubicon, or on the Rhine.<br>
      A wit’s a feather, and a chief a rod;<br>
      An honest man’s the noblest work of God.<br>
      Fame but from death a villain’s name can save,<br>
      As justice tears his body from the grave;<br>
      When what t’ oblivion better were resign’d,<br>
      Is hung on high, to poison half mankind.<br>
      All fame is foreign, but of true desert;<br>
      Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart:<br>
      One self approving hour whole years out-weighs<br>
      Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas;<br>
      And more true joy Marcellus exil’d feels,<br>
      Than Cæsar with a senate at his heels.
      </p>

      <p>
        In parts superior what advantage lies?<br>
      Tell (for you can) what is it to be wise?<br>
      ’Tis but to know how little can be known;<br>
      To see all others’ faults, and feel your own:<br>
      Condemn’d in bus’ness or in arts to drudge,<br>
      Without a second, or without a judge:<br>
      Truths would you teach, or save a sinking land?<br>
      All fear, none aid you, and few understand.<br>
      Painful preëminence! yourself to view<br>
      Above life’s weakness, and its comforts too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bring then these blessings to a strict account;<br>
      Make fair deductions; see to what they ’mount:<br>
      How much of other each is sure to cost;<br>
      How each for other oft is wholly lost;<br>
      How inconsistent greater goods with these;<br>
      How sometimes life is risqu’d, and always ease:<br>
      Think, and if still the things thy envy call,<br>
      Say, would’st thou be the man to whom they fall?<br>
      To sigh for ribbands if thou art so silly,<br>
      Mark how they grace Lord Umbra, or Sir Billy.<br>
      Is yellow dirt the passion of thy life;<br>
      Look but on Gripus, or on Gripus’ wife.<br>
      If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shin’d,<br>
      The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind:<br>
      Or ravish’d with the whistling of a name,<br>
      See Cromwell, damn’d to everlasting fame!<br>
      If all, united, thy ambition call,<br>
      From ancient story learn to scorn them all.<br>
      There, in the rich, the honour’d, fam’d and great,<br>
      See the false scale of happiness complete!<br>
      In hearts of kings, or arms of queens who lay,<br>
      How happy those to ruin, these betray.<br>
      Mark by what wretched steps their glory grows,<br>
      From dirt and sea-weed as proud Venice rose;<br>
      In each how guilt and greatness equal ran,<br>
      And all that rais’d the hero, sunk the man:<br>
      Now Europe’s laurels on their brows behold,<br>
      But stain’d with blood, or ill-exchang’d for gold:<br>
      Then see them broke with toils, or sunk in ease,<br>
      Or infamous for plunder’d provinces.<br>
      Oh, wealth ill-fated! which no act of fame<br>
      E’er taught to shine, or sanctify’d from shame!<br>
      What greater bliss attends their close of life?<br>
      Some greedy minion, or imperious wife,<br>
      The trophy’d arches, story’d halls invade,<br>
      And haunt their slumbers in the pompous shade.<br>
      Alas! not dazzled with their noon-tide ray,<br>
      Compute the morn and ev’ning to the day;<br>
      The whole amount of that enormous fame,<br>
      A tale, that blends their glory with their shame!
      </p>

      <p>
        Know then this truth, enough for man to know,<br>
      ‘Virtue alone is happiness below.’<br>
      The only point where human bliss stands still,<br>
      And tastes the good without the fall to ill;<br>
      Where only merit constant pay receives,<br>
      Is blest in what it takes, and what it gives;<br>
      The joy unequal’d, if its end it gain,<br>
      And if it lose, attended with no pain:<br>
      Without satiety, tho’ e’er so bless’d,<br>
      And but more relish’d as the more distress’d:<br>
      The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears,<br>
      Less pleasing far than virtue’s very tears;<br>
      Good, from each object, from each place acquir’d,<br>
      For ever exercis’d, yet never tir’d;<br>
      Never elated, while one man’s oppress’d;<br>
      Never dejected, while another’s bless’d;<br>
      And where no wants, no wishes can remain,<br>
      Since but to wish more virtue, is to gain.
      </p>

      <p>
        See the sole bliss heav’n could on all bestow!<br>
      Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know:<br>
      Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind,<br>
      The bad must miss, the good, untaught, will find;<br>
      Slave to no sect, who takes no private road,<br>
      But looks through nature up to nature’s God:<br>
      Pursues that chain which links th’ immense design,<br>
      Joins heav’n and earth, and mortal and divine;<br>
      Sees, that no being any bliss can know,<br>
      But touches some above, and some below;<br>
      Learns, from this union of the rising whole,<br>
      The first, last purpose of the human soul;<br>
      And knows where faith, law, morals, all began,<br>
      All end, in love of God, and love of man.
      </p>

      <p>
        For him alone, hope leads from goal to goal,<br>
      And opens still, and opens on his soul;<br>
      ’Till lengthen’d on to faith, and unconfin’d,<br>
      It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind.<br>
      He sees, why nature plants in man alone<br>
      Hope of known bliss, and faith in bliss unknown:<br>
      (Nature, whose dictates to no other kind<br>
      Are giv’n in vain, but what they seek they find)<br>
      Wise is her present; she connects in this<br>
      His greatest virtue with his greatest bliss;<br>
      At once his own bright prospect to be blest,<br>
      And strongest motive to assist the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Self-love thus push’d to social, to divine,<br>
      Gives thee to make thy neighbour’s blessing thine.<br>
      Is this too little for the boundless heart?<br>
      Extend it, let thy enemies have part:<br>
      Grasp the whole worlds of reason, life, and sense,<br>
      In one close system of benevolence:<br>
      Happier as kinder, in whate’er degree,<br>
      And height of bliss but height of charity.
      </p>

      <p>
        God loves from whole to parts: but human soul<br>
      Must rise from individual to the whole.<br>
      Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake<br>
      As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake;<br>
      The centre mov’d, a circle strait succeeds,<br>
      Another still, and still another spreads;<br>
      Friend, parent, neighbour, first it will embrace;<br>
      His country next; and next all human race;<br>
      Wide and more wide, th’ o’erflowings of the mind<br>
      Take ev’ry creature in, of ev’ry kind;<br>
      Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty blest,<br>
      And heav’n beholds its image in his breast.

        Come then, my friend, my genius, come along;<br>
      Oh master of the poet, and the song!<br>
      And while the muse now stoops, or now ascends,<br>
      To man’s low passions, or their glorious ends,<br>
      Teach me, like thee, in various nature wise,<br>
      To fall with dignity, with temper rise;<br>
      Form’d by thy converse, happily to steer<br>
      From grave to gay, from lively to severe;<br>
      Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease,<br>
      Intent to reason, or polite to please.<br>
      Oh! while along the stream of time thy name<br>
      Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame;<br>
      Say, shall my little bark attendant sail,<br>
      Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale?<br>
      When statesmen, heroes, kings, in dust repose,<br>
      Whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes,<br>
      Shall then this verse to future age pretend<br>
      Thou wert my guide, philosopher, and friend?<br>
      That, urg’d by thee, I turn’d the tuneful art<br>
      From sounds to things, from fancy to the heart;<br>
      For wit’s false mirror held up nature’s light;<br>
      Shew’d erring pride, whatever is, is right;<br>
      That reason, passion, answer one great aim;<br>
      That true self-love and social are the same;<br>
      That virtue only makes our bliss below;<br>
      And all our knowledge is, ourselves to know.
