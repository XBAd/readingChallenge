          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" target="_blank">Robert Burns</a> (25 January 1759 – 21 July 1796)
          was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.
          He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature.

        NO Spartan tube, no <span class="tooltip">Attic<span class="tooltiptext">of, relating to, or having the characteristics of Athens or its ancient civilization; marked by simplicity, purity, and refinement</span></span> shell, <br>
          No lyre <span class="tooltip">Æolian<span class="tooltiptext">(Greek Mythology) Of or relating to Aeolus, the god of the winds</span></span> I awake; <br>
        ’Tis liberty’s bold note I swell, <br>
          Thy harp, Columbia, let me take! <br>
        See gathering thousands, while I sing, <br>
        A broken chain exulting bring, <br>
          And dash it in a tyrant’s face, <br>
        And dare him to his very beard, <br>
        And tell him he no more is feared— <br>
          No more the <span class="tooltip">despot<span class="tooltiptext">a ruler or other person who holds absolute power, typically one who exercises it in a cruel or oppressive way.</span></span> of Columbia’s race! <br>
        A tyrant’s proudest insults brav’d, <br>
        They shout—a People freed! They hail an Empire saved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where is man’s god-like form? <br>
          Where is that brow erect and bold—<br>
          That eye that can unmov’d behold<br>
        The wildest rage, the loudest storm<br>
        That e’er created fury dared to raise?<br>
        <span class="tooltip">Avaunt<span class="tooltiptext">(exclamation) go away.</span></span>! thou <span class="tooltip">caitiff<span class="tooltiptext">a contemptible or cowardly person.</span></span>, servile, base,<br>
        That tremblest at a despot’s nod,<br>
        Yet, crouching under the iron rod,<br>
          Canst laud the hand that struck th’ insulting blow!<br>
        Art thou of man’s Imperial line?<br>
        Dost boast that countenance divine?<br>
          Each skulking feature answers, No!<br>
        But come, ye sons of Liberty,<br>
        Columbia’s offspring, brave as free,<br>
        In danger’s hour still flaming in the van,<br>
        Ye know, and dare maintain, the Royalty of Man!
      </p>

      <p>
        Alfred! on thy starry throne,<br>
          Surrounded by the tuneful choir,<br>
          The bards that erst have struck the patriot lyre,<br>
          And rous’d the freeborn Briton’s soul of fire,<br>
        No more thy England own!<br>
        Dare injured nations form the great design,<br>
          To make detested tyrants bleed?<br>
          Thy England <span class="tooltip">execrates<span class="tooltiptext">to declare to be evil or detestable; to detest utterly</span></span> the glorious deed!<br>
          Beneath her hostile banners waving,<br>
          Every pang of honour braving,<br>
        England in thunder calls, “The tyrant’s cause is mine!”<br>
        That hour accurst how did the fiends rejoice<br>
        And hell, thro’ all her confines, raise the exulting voice,<br>
        That hour which saw the generous English name<br>
        Linkt with such damned deeds of everlasting shame!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thee, <span class="tooltip">Caledonia<span class="tooltiptext">Caledonia is the Latin name given by the Romans to the land north of their province of Britannia, beyond the frontier of their empire, roughly corresponding to modern-day Scotland</span></span>! thy wild <span class="tooltip">heaths<span class="tooltiptext">an area of open uncultivated land, especially in Britain, with characteristic vegetation of heather, gorse, and coarse grasses.</span></span> among,<br>
        Fam’d for the martial deed, the heaven-taught song,<br>
          To thee I turn with swimming eyes;<br>
        Where is that soul of Freedom fled?<br>
        Immingled with the mighty dead,<br>
          Beneath that hallow’d turf where Wallace lies<br>
        Hear it not, WALLACE! in thy bed of death.<br>
          Ye babbling winds! in silence sweep,<br>
          Disturb not ye the hero’s sleep,<br>
        Nor give the coward secret breath!<br>
        Is this the ancient Caledonian form,<br>
        Firm as the rock, resistless as the storm?<br>
        Show me that eye which shot immortal hate,<br>
          Blasting the despot’s proudest bearing;<br>
        Show me that arm which, nerv’d with thundering fate,<br>
          Crush’d Usurpation’s boldest daring!—<br>
        Dark-quench’d as yonder sinking star,<br>
        No more that glance lightens afar;
      </p>

      <p>
        That <span class="tooltip">palsied<span class="tooltiptext">Complete or partial muscle paralysis, often accompanied by loss of sensation and uncontrollable body movements or tremors.</span></span> arm no more whirls on the waste of war.
