      <h2>466. Ode for General Washington’s Birthday</h2>

      <p>
        NO Spartan tube, no Attic shell, <br>
          No lyre Æolian I awake; <br>
        ’Tis liberty’s bold note I swell, <br>
          Thy harp, Columbia, let me take! <br>
        See gathering thousands, while I sing, <br>
        A broken chain exulting bring, <br>
          And dash it in a tyrant’s face, <br>
        And dare him to his very beard, <br>
        And tell him he no more is feared— <br>
          No more the despot of Columbia’s race! <br>
        A tyrant’s proudest insults brav’d, <br>
        They shout—a People freed! They hail an Empire saved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where is man’s god-like form? <br>
          Where is that brow erect and bold—<br>
          That eye that can unmov’d behold<br>
        The wildest rage, the loudest storm<br>
        That e’er created fury dared to raise?<br>
        Avaunt! thou caitiff, servile, base,<br>
        That tremblest at a despot’s nod,<br>
        Yet, crouching under the iron rod,<br>
          Canst laud the hand that struck th’ insulting blow!<br>
        Art thou of man’s Imperial line?<br>
        Dost boast that countenance divine?<br>
          Each skulking feature answers, No!<br>
        But come, ye sons of Liberty,<br>
        Columbia’s offspring, brave as free,<br>
        In danger’s hour still flaming in the van,<br>
        Ye know, and dare maintain, the Royalty of Man!
      </p>

      <p>
        Alfred! on thy starry throne,<br>
          Surrounded by the tuneful choir,<br>
          The bards that erst have struck the patriot lyre,<br>
          And rous’d the freeborn Briton’s soul of fire,<br>
        No more thy England own!<br>
        Dare injured nations form the great design,<br>
          To make detested tyrants bleed?<br>
          Thy England execrates the glorious deed!<br>
          Beneath her hostile banners waving,<br>
          Every pang of honour braving,<br>
        England in thunder calls, “The tyrant’s cause is mine!”<br>
        That hour accurst how did the fiends rejoice<br>
        And hell, thro’ all her confines, raise the exulting voice,<br>
        That hour which saw the generous English name<br>
        Linkt with such damned deeds of everlasting shame!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thee, Caledonia! thy wild heaths among,<br>
        Fam’d for the martial deed, the heaven-taught song,<br>
          To thee I turn with swimming eyes;<br>
        Where is that soul of Freedom fled?<br>
        Immingled with the mighty dead,<br>
          Beneath that hallow’d turf where Wallace lies<br>
        Hear it not, WALLACE! in thy bed of death.<br>
          Ye babbling winds! in silence sweep,<br>
          Disturb not ye the hero’s sleep,<br>
        Nor give the coward secret breath!<br>
        Is this the ancient Caledonian form,<br>
        Firm as the rock, resistless as the storm?<br>
        Show me that eye which shot immortal hate,<br>
          Blasting the despot’s proudest bearing;<br>
        Show me that arm which, nerv’d with thundering fate,<br>
          Crush’d Usurpation’s boldest daring!—<br>
        Dark-quench’d as yonder sinking star,<br>
        No more that glance lightens afar;
      </p>

      <p>
        That palsied arm no more whirls on the waste of war.
