      <h2>A Psalm of Life</h2>

      <h2>What the Heart of the Young Man Said to the Psalmist</h2>

      <p>
        TELL me not, in mournful numbers, <br>
          Life is but an empty dream!<br>
        For the soul is dead that slumbers,<br>
          And things are not what they seem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Life is real! Life is earnest!<br>
          And the grave is not its goal;<br>
        Dust thou art, to dust returnest,<br>
          Was not spoken of the soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br>
          Is our destined end or way;<br>
        But to act, that each to-morrow<br>
          Find us farther than to-day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Art is long, and Time is fleeting,<br>
          And our hearts, though stout and brave,<br>
        Still, like muffled drums, are beating<br>
          Funeral marches to the grave.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the world’s broad field of battle,<br>
          In the bivouac of Life,<br>
        Be not like dumb, driven cattle!<br>
          Be a hero in the strife!
      </p>

      <p>
        Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!<br>
          Let the dead Past bury its dead!<br>
        Act,—act in the living Present!<br>
          Heart within, and God o’erhead!
      </p>

      <p>
        Lives of great men all remind us<br>
          We can make our lives sublime,<br>
        And, departing, leave behind us<br>
          Footprints on the sands of time;
      </p>

      <p>
        Footprints, that perhaps another,<br>
          Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,<br>
        A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,<br>
          Seeing, shall take heart again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us, then, be up and doing,<br>
          With a heart for any fate;<br>
        Still achieving, still pursuing,<br>
          Learn to labor and to wait.
      </p>

      <h2>The Light of Stars</h2>

      <p>
        THE NIGHT is come, but not too soon;<br>
          And sinking silently,<br>
        All silently, the little moon<br>
          Drops down behind the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no light in earth or heaven<br>
          But the cold light of stars;<br>
        And the first watch of night is given<br>
          To the red planet Mars.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it the tender star of love?<br>
          The star of love and dreams?<br>
        Oh no! from that blue tent above<br>
          A hero’s armor gleams.
      </p>

      <p>
        And earnest thoughts within me rise,<br>
          When I behold afar,<br>
        Suspended in the evening skies,<br>
          The shield of that red star.
      </p>

      <p>
        O star of strength! I see thee stand<br>
          And smile upon my pain;<br>
        Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand,<br>
          And I am strong again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within my breast there is no light<br>
          But the cold light of stars;<br>
        I give the first watch of the night<br>
          To the red planet Mars.
      </p>

      <p>
        The star of the unconquered will,<br>
          He rises in my breast,<br>
        Serene, and resolute, and still,<br>
          And calm, and self-possessed.
      </p>

      <p>
        And thou, too, whosoe’er thou art,<br>
          That readest this brief psalm,<br>
        As one by one thy hopes depart,<br>
          Be resolute and calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, fear not in a world like this,<br>
          And thou shalt know erelong,<br>
        Know how sublime a thing it is<br>
          To suffer and be strong.
      </p>

      <h2>Hymn to the Night</h2>

      <h2>[Greek]</h2>

      <p>
        I HEARD the trailing garments of the Night<br>
          Sweep through her marble halls!<br>
        I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light<br>
          From the celestial walls!
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt her presence, by its spell of might,<br>
          Stoop o’er me from above;<br>
        The calm, majestic presence of the Night,<br>
          As of the one I love.
      </p>

      <p>
        I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,<br>
          The manifold, soft chimes,<br>
        That fill the haunted chambers of the Night,<br>
          Like some old poet’s rhymes.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the cool cisterns of the midnight air<br>
          My spirit drank repose;<br>
        The fountain of perpetual peace flows there,—<br>
          From those deep cisterns flows.
      </p>

      <p>
        O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear<br>
          What man has borne before!<br>
        Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,<br>
          And they complain no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peace! Peace! Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!<br>
          Descend with broad-winged flight,<br>
        The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,<br>
          The best-beloved Night!
      </p>

      <h2>Footsteps of Angels</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN the hours of Day are numbered,<br>
          And the voices of the Night<br>
        Wake the better soul, that slumbered,<br>
          To a holy, calm delight;
      </p>

      <p>
        Ere the evening lamps are lighted,<br>
          And, like phantoms grim and tall,<br>
        Shadows from the fitful firelight<br>
          Dance upon the parlor wall;
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the forms of the departed<br>
          Enter at the open door;<br>
        The beloved, the true-hearted,<br>
          Come to visit me once more;
      </p>

      <p>
        He, the young and strong, who cherished<br>
          Noble longings for the strife,<br>
        By the roadside fell and perished,<br>
          Weary with the march of life!
      </p>

      <p>
        They, the holy ones and weakly,<br>
          Who the cross of suffering bore,<br>
        Folded their pale hands so meekly,<br>
          Spake with us on earth no more!
      </p>

      <p>
        And with them the Being Beauteous,<br>
          Who unto my youth was given,<br>
        More than all things else to love me,<br>
          And is now a saint in heaven.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a slow and noiseless footstep<br>
          Comes that messenger divine,<br>
        Takes the vacant chair beside me,<br>
          Lays her gentle hand in mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        And she sits and gazes at me<br>
          With those deep and tender eyes,<br>
        Like the stars, so still and saint-like,<br>
          Looking downward from the skies
      </p>

      <p>
        Uttered not, yet comprehended,<br>
          Is the spirit’s voiceless prayer,<br>
        Soft rebukes, in blessings ended,<br>
          Breathing from her lips of air.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, though oft depressed and lonely,<br>
          All my fears are laid aside,<br>
        If I but remember only<br>
          Such as these have lived and died!
      </p>

      <h2>The Wreck of the Hesperus</h2>

      <p>
        IT was the schooner Hesperus,<br>
            That sailed the wintry sea;<br>
        And the skipper had taken his little daughter,<br>
            To bear him company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,<br>
            Her cheeks like the dawn of day,<br>
        And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,<br>
            That ope in the month of May.
      </p>

      <p>
        The skipper he stood beside the helm,<br>
            His pipe was in his mouth,<br>
        And he watched how the veering flaw did blow<br>
            The smoke now West, now South.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then up and spake an old Sailòr,<br>
            Had sailed to the Spanish Main,<br>
        ‘I pray thee, put into yonder port,<br>
            For I fear a hurricane.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Last night, the moon had a golden ring,<br>
            And to-night no moon we see!’<br>
        The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,<br>
            And a scornful laugh laughed he.
      </p>

      <p>
        Colder and louder blew the wind,<br>
            A gale from the Northeast,<br>
        The snow fell hissing in the brine,<br>
            And the billows frothed like yeast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Down came the storm, and smote amain<br>
            The vessel in its strength;<br>
        She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,<br>
            Then leaped her cable’s length.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Come hither! come hither! my little daughtèr,<br>
            And do not tremble so;<br>
        For I can weather the roughest gale<br>
            That ever wind did blow.’
      </p>

      <p>
        He wrapped her warm in his seaman’s coat<br>
            Against the stinging blast;<br>
        He cut a rope from a broken spar,<br>
            And bound her to the mast.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘O father! I hear the church-bells ring,<br>
            Oh say, what may it be?’<br>
        ‘’Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!’—<br>
            And he steered for the open sea.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘O father! I hear the sound of guns,<br>
            Oh say, what may it be?’<br>
        ‘Some ship in distress, that cannot live<br>
            In such an angry sea!’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘O father. I see a gleaming light,<br>
            Oh say, what may it be?’<br>
        But the father answered never a word,<br>
            A frozen corpse was he.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,<br>
            With his face turned to the skies,<br>
        The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow<br>
            On his fixed and glassy eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed<br>
            That savèd she might be;<br>
        And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,<br>
            On the Lake of Galilee.
      </p>

      <p>
        And fast through the midnight dark and drear,<br>
            Through the whistling sleet and snow,<br>
        Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept<br>
            Tow’rds the reef of Norman’s Woe.
      </p>

      <p>
        And ever the fitful gusts between<br>
            A sound came from the land;<br>
        It was the sound of the trampling surf<br>
            On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The breakers were right beneath her bows,<br>
            She drifted a dreary wreck,<br>
        And a whooping billow swept the crew<br>
            Like icicles from her deck.
      </p>

      <p>
        She struck where the white and fleecy waves<br>
            Looked soft as carded wool,<br>
        But the cruel rocks, they gored her side<br>
            Like the horns of an angry bull.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,<br>
            With the masts went by the board;<br>
        Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,<br>
            Ho! ho! the breakers roared!
      </p>

      <p>
        At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,<br>
            A fisherman stood aghast,<br>
        To see the form of a maiden fair,<br>
            Lashed close to a drifting mast.
      </p>

      <p>
        The salt sea was frozen on her breast,<br>
            The salt tears in her eyes;<br>
        And he saw her hair, like the brown seaweed,<br>
            On the billows fall and rise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,<br>
            In the midnight and the snow!<br>
        Christ save us all from a death like this,<br>
            On the reef of Norman’s Woe!
      </p>

      <h2>The Village Blacksmith</h2>

      <p>
        UNDER a spreading chestnut-tree<br>
          The village smithy stands;<br>
        The smith, a mighty man is he,<br>
          With large and sinewy hands;<br>
        And the muscles of his brawny arm<br>
          Are strong as iron bands.
      </p>

      <p>
        His hair is crisp, and black, and long,<br>
          His face is like the tan;<br>
        His brow is wet with honest sweat,<br>
          He earns whate’er he can,<br>
        And looks the whole world in the face,<br>
          For he owes not any man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Week in, week out, from morn till night,<br>
          You can hear his bellows blow;<br>
        You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,<br>
          With measured beat and slow,<br>
        Like a sexton ringing the village bell,<br>
          When the evening sun is low.
      </p>

      <p>
        And children coming home from school<br>
          Look in at the open door;<br>
        They love to see the flaming forge,<br>
          And hear the bellows roar,<br>
        And catch the burning sparks that fly,<br>
          Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        He goes on Sunday to the church,<br>
          And sits among his boys;<br>
        He hears the parson pray and preach,<br>
          He hears his daughter’s voice,<br>
        Singing in the village choir,<br>
          And it makes his heart rejoice.
      </p>

      <p>
        It sounds to him like her mother’s voice,<br>
          Singing in Paradise!<br>
        He needs must think of her once more<br>
          How in the grave she lies;<br>
        And with his hard, rough hand he wipes<br>
          A tear out of his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Toiling,—rejoicing,—sorrowing,<br>
          Onward through life he goes;<br>
        Each morning sees some task begin,<br>
          Each evening sees it close;<br>
        Something attempted, something done.<br>
          Has earned a night’s repose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,<br>
          For the lesson thou hast taught!<br>
        Thus at the flaming forge of life<br>
          Our fortunes must be wrought;<br>
        Thus on its sounding anvil shaped<br>
          Each burning deed and thought.
      </p>

      <h2>Serenade</h2>

      <h2>From ‘The Spanish Student’</h2>

      <p>
        STARS of the summer night!<br>
            Far in yon azure deeps,<br>
        Hide, hide your golden light!<br>
            She sleeps!<br>
        My lady sleeps!<br>
            Sleeps!
      </p>

      <p>
        Moon of the summer night!<br>
            Far down yon western steeps,<br>
        Sink, sink in silver light!<br>
            She sleeps!<br>
        My lady sleeps!<br>
            Sleeps!
      </p>

      <p>
        Wind of the summer night!<br>
            Where yonder woodbine creeps,<br>
        Fold, fold thy pinions light!<br>
            She sleeps!<br>
        My lady sleeps!<br>
            Sleeps!
      </p>

      <p>
        Dreams of the summer night!<br>
            Tell her, her lover keeps<br>
        Watch! while in slumbers light<br>
            She sleeps!<br>
        My lady sleeps!<br>
            Sleeps!
      </p>

      <h2>The Rainy Day</h2>

      <p>
        THE DAY is cold, and dark, and dreary;<br>
        It rains, and the wind is never weary;<br>
        The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,<br>
        But at every gust the dead leaves fall,<br>
            And the day is dark and dreary.
      </p>

      <p>
        My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;<br>
        It rains, and the wind is never weary;<br>
        My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past,<br>
        But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,<br>
            And the days are dark and dreary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;<br>
        Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;<br>
        Thy fate is the common fate of all,<br>
        Into each life some rain must fall,<br>
            Some days must be dark and dreary.
      </p>

      <h2>The Day is Done</h2>

      <p>
        THE DAY is done, and the darkness<br>
          Falls from the wings of Night,<br>
        As a feather is wafted downward<br>
          From an eagle in his flight.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see the lights of the village<br>
          Gleam through the rain and the mist,<br>
        And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me<br>
          That my soul cannot resist:
      </p>

      <p>
        A feeling of sadness and longing,<br>
          That is not akin to pain,<br>
        And resembles sorrow only<br>
          As the mist resembles the rain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Come, read to me some poem,<br>
          Some simple and heartfelt lay,<br>
        That shall soothe this restless feeling,<br>
          And banish the thoughts of day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not from the grand old masters,<br>
          Not from the bards sublime,<br>
        Whose distant footsteps echo<br>
          Through the corridors of Time.
      </p>

      <p>
        For, like strains of martial music,<br>
          Their mighty thoughts suggest<br>
        Life’s endless toil and endeavor;<br>
          And to-night I long for rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Read from some humbler poet,<br>
          Whose songs gushed from his heart,<br>
        As showers from the clouds of summer,<br>
          Or tears from the eyelids start;
      </p>

      <p>
        Who, through long days of labor,<br>
          And nights devoid of ease,<br>
        Still heard in his soul the music<br>
          Of wonderful melodies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such songs have power to quiet<br>
          The restless pulse of care,<br>
        And come like the benediction<br>
          That follows after prayer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then read from the treasured volume<br>
          The poem of thy choice,<br>
        And lend to the rhyme of the poet<br>
          The beauty of thy voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the night shall be filled with music,<br>
          And the cares, that infest the day,<br>
        Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,<br>
          And as silently steal away.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bridge</h2>

      <p>
        I STOOD on the bridge at midnight,<br>
          As the clocks were striking the hour,<br>
        And the moon rose o’er the city,<br>
          Behind the dark church-tower.
      </p>

      <p>
        I saw her bright reflection<br>
          In the waters under me,<br>
        Like a golden goblet falling<br>
          And sinking into the sea.
      </p>

      <p>
        And far in the hazy distance<br>
          Of that lovely night in June,<br>
        The blaze of the flaming furnace<br>
          Gleamed redder than the moon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the long, black rafters<br>
          The wavering shadows lay,<br>
        And the current that came from the ocean<br>
          Seemed to lift and bear them away;
      </p>

      <p>
        As, sweeping and eddying through them,<br>
          Rose the belated tide,<br>
        And, streaming into the moonlight,<br>
          The seaweed floated wide.
      </p>

      <p>
        And like those waters rushing<br>
          Among the wooden piers,<br>
        A flood of thoughts came o’er me<br>
          That filled my eyes with tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        How often, oh how often,<br>
          In the days that had gone by,<br>
        I had stood on that bridge at midnight<br>
          And gazed on that wave and sky!
      </p>

      <p>
        How often, oh how often,<br>
          I had wished that the ebbing tide<br>
        Would bear me away on its bosom<br>
          O’er the ocean wild and wide!
      </p>

      <p>
        For my heart was hot and restless,<br>
          And my life was full of care,<br>
        And the burden laid upon me<br>
          Seemed greater than I could bear.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now it has fallen from me,<br>
          It is buried in the sea;<br>
        And only the sorrow of others<br>
          Throws its shadow over me,
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet whenever I cross the river<br>
          On its bridge with wooden piers,<br>
        Like the odor of brine from the ocean<br>
          Comes the thought of other years.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I think how many thousands<br>
          Of care-encumbered men,<br>
        Each bearing his burden of sorrow,<br>
          Have crossed the bridge since then.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see the long procession<br>
          Still passing to and fro,<br>
        The young heart hot and restless,<br>
          And the old subdued and slow!
      </p>

      <p>
        And forever and forever,<br>
          As long as the river flows,<br>
        As long as the heart has passions,<br>
          As long as life has woes;
      </p>

      <p>
        The moon and its broken reflection<br>
          And its shadows shall appear,<br>
        As the symbol of love in heaven,<br>
          And its wavering image here.
      </p>

      <h2>Resignation</h2>

      <p>
        THERE is no flock, however watched and tended,<br>
          But one dead lamb is there!<br>
        There is no fireside, howsoe’er defended,<br>
          But has one vacant chair!
      </p>

      <p>
        The air is full of farewells to the dying,<br>
          And mournings for the dead;<br>
        The heart of Rachel, for her children crying,<br>
          Will not be comforted!
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us be patient! These severe afflictions<br>
          Not from the ground arise,<br>
        But oftentimes celestial benedictions<br>
          Assume this dark disguise.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see but dimly through the mists and vapors;<br>
          Amid these earthly damps<br>
        What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers<br>
          May be heaven’s distant lamps.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no Death! What seems so is transition;<br>
          This life of mortal breath<br>
        Is but a suburb of the life elysian,<br>
          Whose portal we call Death.
      </p>

      <p>
        She is not dead,—the child of our affection,—<br>
          But gone unto that school<br>
        Where she no longer needs our poor protection,<br>
          And Christ himself doth rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that great cloister’s stillness and seclusion,<br>
          By guardian angels led,<br>
        Safe from temptation, safe from sin’s pollution,<br>
          She lives whom we call dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Day after day we think what she is doing<br>
          In those bright realms of air;<br>
        Year after year, her tender steps pursuing,<br>
          Behold her grown more fair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus do we walk with her, and keep unbroken,<br>
          The bond which nature gives,<br>
        Thinking that our remembrance, though unspoken,<br>
          May reach her where she lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not as a child shall we again behold her;<br>
          For when with raptures wild<br>
        In our embraces we again enfold her,<br>
          She will not be a child;
      </p>

      <p>
        But a fair maiden, in her Father’s mansion,<br>
          Clothed with celestial grace;<br>
        And beautiful with all the soul’s expansion<br>
          Shall we behold her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        And though at times impetuous with emotion<br>
          And anguish long suppressed,<br>
        The swelling heart heaves moaning like the ocean,<br>
          That cannot be at rest,—
      </p>

      <p>
        We will be patient, and assuage the feeling<br>
          We may not wholly stay;<br>
        By silence sanctifying, not concealing,<br>
          The grief that must have way.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>

      <p>
        COME to me, O ye children!<br>
          For I hear you at your play,<br>
        And the questions that perplexed me<br>
          Have vanished quite away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ye open the eastern windows,<br>
          That look towards the sun,<br>
        Where thoughts are singing swallows<br>
          And the brooks of morning run.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your hearts are the birds and the sunshine,<br>
          In your thoughts the brooklet’s flow,<br>
        But in mine is the wind of Autumn<br>
          And the first fall of the snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah! what would the world be to us<br>
          If the children were no more?<br>
        We should dread the desert behind us<br>
          Worse than the dark before.
      </p>

      <p>
        What the leaves are to the forest,<br>
          With light and air for food,<br>
        Ere their sweet and tender juices<br>
          Have been hardened into wood,—
      </p>

      <p>
        That to the world are children;<br>
          Through them it feels the glow<br>
        Of a brighter and sunnier climate<br>
          Than reaches the trunks below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Come to me, O ye children!<br>
          And whisper in my ear<br>
        What the birds and the winds are singing<br>
          In your sunny atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        For what are all our contrivings,<br>
          And the wisdom of our books,<br>
        When compared with your caresses,<br>
          And the gladness of your looks?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ye are better than all the ballads<br>
          That ever were sung or said;<br>
        For ye are living poems,<br>
          And all the rest are dead.
