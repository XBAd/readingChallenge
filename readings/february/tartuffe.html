      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene I</h2>

      <p>
        MADAME PERNELLE and FLIPOTTE, her servant;  ELMIRE,  MARIANE,  CLÉANTE,  DAMIS,  DORINE
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Madame Pernelle</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Come, come, Flipotte, and let me get away.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Elmire</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        You hurry so, I hardly can attend you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Madame Pernelle</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Then don’t, my daughter-in-law. Stay where you are. <br>
        I can dispense with your polite attentions.
      </p>

      <p><em>Elmire</em></p>

      <p>
        We’re only paying what is due you, mother.<br>
        Why must you go away in such a hurry?
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        Because I can’t endure your carryings-on,<br>
        And no one takes the slightest pains to please me.<br>
        I leave your house, I tell you, quite disgusted;<br>
        You do the opposite of my instructions;<br>
        You’ve no respect for anything; each one<br>
        Must have his say; it’s perfect pandemonium.
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        If…
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        You’re a servant wench, my girl, and much<br>
      Too full of gab, and too impertinent<br>
      And free with your advice on all occasions.
      </p>

      <p><em>Damis</em></p>

      <p>
        But…
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        You’re a fool, my boy—f, o, o, l<br>
      Just spells your name. Let grandma tell you that<br>
      I’ve said a hundred times to my poor son,<br>
      Your father, that you’d never come to good<br>
      Or give him anything but plague and torment.
      </p>

      <p><em>Mariane</em></p>

      <p>
        I think…
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        O dearie me, his little sister!<br>
      You’re all demureness, butter wouldn’t melt<br>
      In your mouth, one would think to look at you.<br>
      Still waters, though, they say … you know the proverb;<br>
      And I don’t like your doings on the sly.
      </p>

      <p><em>Elmire</em></p>

      <p>
        But, mother…
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        Daughter, by your leave, your conduct<br>
      In everything is altogether wrong;<br>
      You ought to set a good example for ’em;<br>
      Their dear departed mother did much better.<br>
      You are extravagant; and it offends me,<br>
      To see you always decked out like a princess.<br>
      A woman who would please her husband’s eyes<br>
      Alone, wants no such wealth of fineries.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        But, madam, after all…
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        Sir, as for you,<br>
      The lady’s brother, I esteem you highly,<br>
      Love and respect you. But, sir, all the same,<br>
      If I were in my son’s, her husband’s, place,<br>
      I’d urgently entreat you not to come<br>
      Within our doors. You preach a way of living<br>
      That decent people cannot tolerate.<br>
      I’m rather frank with you; but that’s my way—<br>
      I don’t mince matters, when I mean a thing.
      </p>

      <p><em>Damis</em></p>

      <p>
        Mr. Tartuffe, your friend, is mighty lucky…
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        He is a holy man, and must be heeded;<br>
        I can’t endure, with any show of patience,<br>
        To hear a scatterbrains like you attack him.
      </p>

      <p><em>Damis</em></p>

      <p>
        What! Shall I let a bigot criticaster<br>
        Come and usurp a tyrant’s power here?<br>
        And shall we never dare amuse ourselves<br>
        Till this fine gentleman deigns to consent?
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        If we must hark to him, and heed his maxims,<br>
        There’s not a thing we do but what’s a crime;<br>
        He censures everything, this zealous carper.
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        And all he censures is well censured, too.<br>
        He wants to guide you on the way to heaven;<br>
        My son should train you all to love him well.
      </p>

      <p><em>Damis</em></p>

      <p>
        No, madam, look you, nothing—not my father<br>
        Nor anything—can make me tolerate him.<br>
        I should belie my feelings not to say so.<br>
        His actions rouse my wrath at every turn;<br>
        And I foresee that there must come of it<br>
        An open rupture with this sneaking scoundrel.
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Besides, ’tis downright scandalous to see<br>
        This unknown upstart master of the house—<br>
        This vagabond, who hadn’t, when he came,<br>
        Shoes to his feet, or clothing worth six farthings,<br>
        And who so far forgets his place, as now<br>
        To censure everything, and rule the roost!
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        Eh! Mercy sakes alive! Things would go better<br>
        If all were governed by his pious orders.
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        He passes for a saint in your opinion.<br>
        In fact, he’s nothing but a hypocrite.
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        Just listen to her tongue!
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        I wouldn’t trust him,<br>
      Nor yet his Lawrence, without bonds and surety.
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        I don’t know what the servant’s character<br>
        May be; but I can guarantee the master<br>
        A holy man. You hate him and reject him<br>
        Because he tells home truths to all of you.<br>
        ’Tis sin alone that moves his heart to anger,<br>
        And heaven’s interest is his only motive.
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Of course. But why, especially of late,<br>
        Can he let nobody come near the house?<br>
        Is heaven offended at a civil call<br>
        That he should make so great a fuss about it?<br>
        I’ll tell you, if you like, just what I think;  (Pointing to Elmire)<br>
        Upon my word, he’s jealous of our mistress.
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        You hold your tongue, and think what you are saying.<br>
        He’s not alone in censuring these visits;<br>
        The turmoil that attends your sort of people,<br>
        Their carriages forever at the door,<br>
        And all their noisy footmen, flocked together,<br>
        Annoy the neighbourhood, and raise a scandal.<br>
        I’d gladly think there’s nothing really wrong;<br>
        But it makes talk; and that’s not as it should be.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Eh! madam, can you hope to keep folk’s tongues<br>
        From wagging? It would be a grievous thing<br>
        If, for the fear of idle talk about us,<br>
        We had to sacrifice our friends. No, no;<br>
        Even if we could bring ourselves to do it,<br>
        Think you that everyone would then be silenced?<br>
        Against backbiting there is no defence<br>
        So let us try to live in innocence,<br>
        To silly tattle pay no heed at all,<br>
        And leave the gossips free to vent their gall.
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Our neighbour Daphne, and her little husband,<br>
        Must be the ones who slander us, I’m thinking.<br>
        Those whose own conduct’s most ridiculous,<br>
        Are always quickest to speak ill of others;<br>
        They never fail to seize at once upon<br>
        The slightest hint of any love affair,<br>
        And spread the news of it with glee, and give it<br>
        The character they’d have the world believe in.<br>
        By others’ actions, painted in their colours,<br>
        They hope to justify their own; they think,<br>
        In the false hope of some resemblance, either<br>
        To make their own intrigues seem innocent,<br>
        Or else to make their neighbours share the blame<br>
        Which they are loaded with by everybody.
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle</em></p>

      <p>
        These arguments are nothing to the purpose.<br>
        Orante, we all know, lives a perfect life;<br>
        Her thoughts are all of heaven; and I have heard<br>
        That she condemns the company you keep.
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        O admirable pattern! Virtuous dame!<br>
        She lives the model of austerity;<br>
        But age has brought this piety upon her,<br>
        And she’s a prude, now she can’t help herself.<br>
        As long as she could capture men’s attentions<br>
        She made the most of her advantages;<br>
        But, now she sees her beauty vanishing,<br>
        She wants to leave the world, that’s leaving her,<br>
        And in the specious veil of haughty virtue<br>
        She’d hide the weakness of her worn-out charms.<br>
        That is the way with all your old coquettes;<br>
        They find it hard to see their lovers leave ’em;<br>
        And thus abandoned, their forlorn estate<br>
        Can find no occupation but a prude’s.<br>
        These pious dames, in their austerity,<br>
        Must carp at everything, and pardon nothing.<br>
        They loudly blame their neighbours’ way of living,<br>
        Not for religion’s sake, but out of envy,<br>
        Because they can’t endure to see another<br>
        Enjoy the pleasures age has weaned them from.
      </p>

      <p><em>Madame Pernelle (to ELMIRE)</em></p>

      <p>
        There! That’s the kind of rigmarole to please you,<br>
        Daughter-in-law. One never has a chance<br>
        To get a word in edgewise, at your house,<br>
        Because this lady holds the floor all day;<br>
        But none the less, I mean to have my say, too.<br>
        I tell you that my son did nothing wiser<br>
        In all his life, than take this godly man<br>
        Into his household; heaven sent him here,<br>
        In your great need, to make you all repent;<br>
        For your salvation, you must hearken to him;<br>
        He censures nothing but deserves his censure.<br>
        These visits, these assemblies, and these balls,<br>
        Are all inventions of the evil spirit.<br>
        You never hear a word of godliness<br>
        At them—but idle cackle, nonsense, flimflam.<br>
        Our neighbour often comes in for a share,<br>
        The talk flies fast, and scandal fills the air;<br>
        It makes a sober person’s head go round,<br>
        At these assemblies, just to hear the sound<br>
        Of so much gab, with not a word to say;<br>
        And as a learned man remarked one day<br>
        Most aptly, ’tis the Tower of Babylon,<br>
        Where all, beyond all limit, babble on.<br>
        And just to tell you how this point came in…
      </p>

      <p><em>(To CLÉANTE)</em></p>

      <p>
        So! Now the gentlemen must snicker, must he?<br>
        Go find fools like yourself to make you laugh<br>
        And don’t…
      </p>

      <p><em>(To ELMIRE)</em></p>

      <p>
        Daughter, good-bye; not one word more.<br>
      As for this house, I leave the half unsaid;<br>
      But I shan’t soon set foot in it again,
      </p>

      <p><em>(Cuffing FLIPOTTE)</em></p>

      <p>
        Come, you! What makes you dream and stand agape,<br>
        Hussy! I’ll warm your ears in proper shape!<br>
        March, trollop, march!
      </p>

      <h2>Act II</h2>

      <p>
        CLÉANTE,  DORINE
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        I won’t escort her down,<br>
        For fear she might fall foul of me again;<br>
        The good old lady…
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Bless us! What a pity<br>
      She shouldn’t hear the way you speak of her!<br>
      She’d surely tell you you’re too “good” by half,<br>
      And that she’s not so “old” as all that, neither!
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        How she got angry with us all for nothing!<br>
        And how she seems possessed with her Tartuffe!
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Her case is nothing, though, beside her son’s!<br>
        To see him, you would say he’s ten times worse!<br>
        His conduct in our late unpleasantness<br>
        Had won him much esteem, and proved his courage<br>
        In service of his king; but now he’s like<br>
        A man besotted, since he’s been so taken<br>
        With this Tartuffe. He calls him brother, loves him<br>
        A hundred times as much as mother, son,<br>
        Daughter, and wife. He tells him all his secrets<br>
        And lets him guide his acts, and rule his conscience.<br>
        He fondles and embraces him; a sweetheart<br>
        Could not, I think, be loved more tenderly;<br>
        At table he must have the seat of honour,<br>
        While with delight our master sees him eat<br>
        As much as six men could; we must give up<br>
        The choicest tidbits to him; if he belches,  (’tis a servant speaking)<br>
        Master exclaims: “God bless you!”—Oh, he dotes<br>
        Upon him! he’s his universe, his hero;<br>
        He’s lost in constant admiration, quotes him<br>
        On all occasions, takes his trifling acts<br>
        For wonders, and his words for oracles.<br>
        The fellow knows his dupe, and makes the most on’t,<br>
        He fools him with a hundred masks of virtue,<br>
        Gets money from him all the time by canting,<br>
        And takes upon himself to carp at us.<br>
        Even his silly coxcomb of a lackey<br>
        Makes it his business to instruct us too;<br>
        He comes with rolling eyes to preach at us,<br>
        And throws away our ribbons, rouge, and patches.<br>
        The wretch, the other day, tore up a kerchief<br>
        That he had found, pressed in the Golden Legend,<br>
        Calling it a horrid crime for us to mingle<br>
        The devil’s finery with holy things.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene III</h2>

      <p>
        ELMIRE,  MARIANE,  DAMIS,  CLÉANTE,  DORINE
      </p>

      <p><em>Elmire, to CLÉANTE</em></p>

      <p>
        You’re very lucky to have missed the speech<br>
        She gave us at the door. I see my husband<br>
        Is home again. He hasn’t seen me yet,<br>
        So I’ll go up and wait till he comes in.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        And I, to save time, will await him here;<br>
        I’ll merely say good-morning, and be gone.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene IV</h2>

      <p>
        CLÉANTE,  DAMIS,  DORINE
      </p>

      <p><em>Damis</em></p>

      <p>
        I wish you’d say a word to him about<br>
        My sister’s marriage; I suspect Tartuffe<br>
        Opposes it, and puts my father up<br>
        To all these wretched shifts. You know, besides,<br>
        How nearly I’m concerned in it myself;<br>
        If love unites my sister and Valere,<br>
        I love his sister too; and if this marriage
        Were to…
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        He’s coming.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene V</h2>

      <p>
        ORGON,  CLÉANTE,  DORINE
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Ah! Good morning, brother.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        I was just going, but am glad to greet you.<br>
        Things are not far advanced yet, in the country?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Dorine…
      </p>

      <p><em>(To CLÉANTE)</em></p>

      <p>
        Just wait a bit, please, brother-in-law.<br>
      Let me allay my first anxiety<br>
      By asking news about the family.
      </p>

      <p><em>(To DORINE)</em></p>

      <p>
        Has everything gone well these last two days?<br>
        What’s happening? And how is everybody?
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Madam had fever, and a splitting headache<br>
        Day before yesterday, all day and evening.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        And how about Tartuffe?
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Tartuffe? He’s well;<br>
      He’s mighty well; stout, fat, fair, rosy-lipped.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Poor man!
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        At evening she had nausea<br>
      And could’t touch a single thing for supper,<br>
      Her headache still was so severe.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        And how<br>
      About Tartuffe?
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        He supped alone, before her,<br>
      And unctuously ate up two partridges,<br>
      As well as half a leg o’ mutton, deviled.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Poor man!
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        All night she couldn’t get a wink<br>
      Of sleep, the fever racked her so; and we<br>
      Had to sit up with her till daylight.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        How<br>
      About Tartuffe?
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        Gently inclined to slumber,<br>
      He left the table, went into his room,<br>
      Got himself straight into a good warm bed,<br>
      And slept quite undisturbed until next morning.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Poor man!
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        At last she let us all persuade her,<br>
      And got up courage to be bled; and then<br>
      She was relieved at once.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        And how about<br>
      Tartuffe?
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        He plucked up courage properly,<br>
      Bravely entrenched his soul against all evils,<br>
      And to replace the blood that she had lost,<br>
      He drank at breakfast four huge draughts of wine.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Poor man!
      </p>

      <p><em>Dorine</em></p>

      <p>
        So now they both are doing well;<br>
        And I’ll go straightway and inform my mistress<br>
        How pleased you are at her recovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene VI</h2>

      <p>
        ORGON,  CLÉANTE
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Brother, she ridicules you to your face;<br>
        And I, though I don’t want to make you angry,<br>
        Must tell you candidly that she’s quite right.<br>
        Was such infatuation ever heard of?<br>
        And can a man to-day have charms to make you<br>
        Forget all else, relieve his poverty,<br>
        Give him a home, and then…?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Stop there, good brother,<br>
      You do not know the man you’re speaking of.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Since you will have it so, I do not know him;<br>
        But after all, to tell what sort of man<br>
        He is…
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Dear brother, you’d be charmed to know him;<br>
      Your raptures over him would have no end.<br>
      He is a man … who … ah! … in fact … a man<br>
      Whoever does his will, knows perfect peace,<br>
      And counts the whole world else, as so much dung.<br>
      His converse has transformed me quite; he weans<br>
      My heart from every friendship, teaches me<br>
      To have no love for anything on earth;<br>
      And I could see my brother, children, mother,<br>
      And wife, all die, and never care—a snap.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Your feelings are humane, I must say, brother!
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Ah! If you’d seen him, as I saw him first,<br>
        You would have loved him just as much as I<br>
        He came to church each day, with contrite mien,<br>
        Kneeled, on both knees, right opposite my place,<br>
        And drew the eyes of all the congregation,<br>
        To watch the fervour of his prayers to heaven;<br>
        With deep-drawn sighs and great ejaculations,<br>
        He humbly kissed the earth at every moment;<br>
        And when I left the church, he ran before me<br>
        To give me holy water at the door.<br>
        I learned his poverty, and who he was,<br>
        By questioning his servant, who is like him,<br>
        And gave him gifts; but in his modesty<br>
        He always wanted to return a part.<br>
        “It is too much,” he’d say, “too much by half;<br>
        I am not worthy of your pity.” Then,<br>
        When I refused to take it back, he’d go,<br>
        Before my eyes, and give it to the poor.<br>
        At length heaven bade me take him to my home,<br>
        And since that day, all seems to prosper here.<br>
        He censures everything, and for my sake<br>
        He even takes great interest in my wife;<br>
        He lets me know who ogles her, and seems<br>
        Six times as jealous as I am myself.<br>
        You’d not believe how far his zeal can go:<br>
        He calls himself a sinner just for trifles;<br>
        The merest nothing is enough to shock him;<br>
        So much so, that the other day I heard him<br>
        Accuse himself for having, while at prayer,<br>
        In too much anger caught and killed a flea.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Zounds, brother, you are mad, I think! Or else<br>
        You’re making sport of me, with such a speech.<br>
        What are you driving at with all this nonsense…?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Brother, your language smacks of atheism;<br>
        And I suspect your soul’s a little tainted<br>
        Therewith. I’ve preached to you a score of times<br>
        That you’ll draw down some judgment on your head.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        That is the usual strain of all your kind;<br>
        They must have every one as blind as they.<br>
        They call you atheist if you have good eyes;<br>
        And if you don’t adore their vain grimaces,<br>
        You’ve neither faith nor care for sacred things.<br>
        No, no; such talk can’t frighten me; I know<br>
        What I am saying; heaven sees my heart.<br>
        We’re not the dupes of all your canting mummers;<br>
        There are false heroes—and false devotees;<br>
        And as true heroes never are the ones<br>
        Who make much noise about their deeds of honour,<br>
        Just so true devotees, whom we should follow,<br>
        Are not the ones who make so much vain show.<br>
        What! Will you find no difference between<br>
        Hypocrisy and genuine devoutness?<br>
        And will you treat them both alike, and pay<br>
        The self-same honour both to masks and faces<br>
        Set artifice beside sincerity,<br>
        Confuse the semblance with reality,<br>
        Esteem a phantom like a living person,<br>
        And counterfeit as good as honest coin?<br>
        Men, for the most part, are strange creatures, truly!<br>
        You never find them keep the golden mean;<br>
        The limits of good sense, too narrow for them,<br>
        Must always be passed by, in each direction;<br>
        They often spoil the noblest things, because<br>
        They go too far, and push them to extremes.<br>
        I merely say this by the way, good brother.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        You are the sole expounder of the doctrine;<br>
        Wisdom shall die with you, no doubt, good brother,<br>
        You are the only wise, the sole enlightened,<br>
        The oracle, the Cato, of our age.<br>
        All men, compared to you, are downright fools.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        I’m not the sole expounder of the doctrine,<br>
        And wisdom shall not die with me, good brother.<br>
        But this I know, though it be all my knowledge,<br>
        That there’s a difference ’twixt false and true.<br>
        And as I find no kind of hero more<br>
        To be admired than men of true religion,<br>
        Nothing more noble or more beautiful<br>
        Than is the holy zeal of true devoutness;<br>
        Just so I think there’s naught more odious<br>
        Than whited sepulchres of outward unction,<br>
        Those barefaced charlatans, those hireling zealots,<br>
        Whose sacrilegious, treacherous pretence<br>
        Deceives at will, and with impunity<br>
        Makes mockery of all that men hold sacred;<br>
        Men who, enslaved to selfish interests,<br>
        Make trade and merchandise of godliness,<br>
        And try to purchase influence and office<br>
        With false eye-rollings and affected raptures;<br>
        Those men, I say, who with uncommon zeal<br>
        Seek their own fortunes on the road to heaven;<br>
        Who, skilled in prayer, have always much to ask,<br>
        And live at court to preach retirement;<br>
        Who reconcile religion with their vices,<br>
        Are quick to anger, vengeful, faithless, tricky,<br>
        And, to destroy a man, will have the boldness<br>
        To call their private grudge the cause of heaven;<br>
        All the more dangerous, since in their anger<br>
        They use against us weapons men revere,<br>
        And since they make the world applaud their passion,<br>
        And seek to stab us with a sacred sword.<br>
        There are too many of this canting kind.<br>
        Still, the sincere are easy to distinguish;<br>
        And many splendid patterns may be found,<br>
        In our own time, before our very eyes<br>
        Look at Ariston, Périandre, Oronte,<br>
        Alcidamas, Clitandre, and Polydore;<br>
        No one denies their claim to true religion;<br>
        Yet they’re no braggadocios of virtue,<br>
        They do not make insufferable display,<br>
        And their religion’s human, tractable;<br>
        They are not always judging all our actions,<br>
        They’d think such judgment savoured of presumption;<br>
        And, leaving pride of words to other men,<br>
        ’Tis by their deeds alone they censure ours.<br>
        Evil appearances find little credit<br>
        With them; they even incline to think the best<br>
        Of others. No caballers, no intriguers,<br>
        They mind the business of their own right living.<br>
        They don’t attack a sinner tooth and nail,<br>
        For sin’s the only object of their hatred;<br>
        Nor are they over-zealous to attempt<br>
        Far more in heaven’s behalf than heaven would have ’em.<br>
        That is my kind of man, that is true living,<br>
        That is the pattern we should set ourselves.<br>
        Your fellow was not fashioned on this model;<br>
        You’re quite sincere in boasting of his zeal;<br>
        But you’re deceived, I think, by false pretences.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        My dear good brother-in-law, have you quite done?
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        I’m your humble servant.
      </p>

      <p>(Starts to go.)</p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Just a word.<br>
      We’ll drop that other subject. But you know<br>
      Valere has had the promise of your daughter.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        You had named the happy day.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        ’Tis true.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Then why put off the celebration of it?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        I can’t say.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Can you have some other plan<br>
      In mind?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Perhaps
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        You mean to break your word?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        I don’t say that.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        I hope no obstacle<br>
      Can keep you from performing what you’ve promised.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Well, that depends.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Why must you beat about?<br>
      Valere has sent me here to settle matters.
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Heaven be praised!
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        What answer shall I take him?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Why, anything you please.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        But we must know<br>
      Your plans. What are they?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        I shall do the will<br>
      Of Heaven.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante</em></p>

      <p>
        Come, be serious. You’ve given<br>
      Your promise to Valère. Now will you keep it?
      </p>

      <p><em>Orgon</em></p>

      <p>
        Good-bye.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cléante (alone)</em></p>

      <p>
        His love, methinks, has much to fear;<br>
      I must go let him know what’s happening here.
