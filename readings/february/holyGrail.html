      <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
      <h3>HOW THE QUEEN DESIRED TO SEE GALAHAD; AND HOW AFTER, ALL THE
KNIGHTS WERE REPLENISHED WITH THE HOLY SANGREAL, AND
HOW THEY AVOWED THE ENQUEST OF THE SAME</h3>

      <p>
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>hen the king, at the queen's request, made him to alight and
to unlace his helm, that the queen might see him in the visage. When
she beheld him she said: Soothly I dare well say that Sir Launcelot
begat him, for never two men resembled more in likeness, therefore
it is no marvel though he be of great prowess. So a lady that stood by the queen said: Madam, for God's sake ought he of right to be
so good a knight? Yea, forsooth, said the queen, for he is of all parties come of the best knights of the world and of the highest
lineage; for Sir Launcelot is come but of the eighth degree from
our Lord Jesu Christ, and Sir Galahad is of the ninth degree from
our Lord Jesu Christ, therefore I dare say they be the greatest gentlemen
of the world. And then the king and all estates went home
unto Camelot, and so went to evensong to the great minster, and
so after upon that to supper, and every knight sat in his own place as they were toforehand. Then anon they heard cracking and crying
of thunder, that them thought the place should all to drive. In the
midst of this blast entered a sunbeam more clearer by seven times
than ever they saw day, and all they were alighted of the grace of the Holy Ghost. Then began every knight to behold other, and either saw other, by their seeming, fairer than ever they saw afore. Not for then there was no knight might speak one word a great while, and
so they looked every man on other as they had been dumb. Then
there entered into the hall the Holy Greal covered with white samite,
but there was none might see it, nor who bare it. And there was all the hall fulfilled with good odours, and every knight had such meats
and drinks as he best loved in this world. And when the Holy Greal
had been borne through the hall, then the Holy Vessel departed
suddenly, that they wist not where it became: then had they all breath to speak. And then the king yielded thankings to God, of
His good grace that he had sent them. Certes, said the king, we
ought to thank our Lord Jesu greatly for that he hath shewed us
this day, at the reverence of this high feast of Pentecost. Now, said
Sir Gawaine, we have been served this day of what meats and drinks we thought on; but one thing beguiled us, we might not see the
holy Grail, it was so preciously covered. Wherefore I will make here
avow, that tomorn, without longer abiding, I shall labour in the
quest of the Sangreal, that I shall hold me out a twelvemonth and a
day, or more if need be, and never shall I return again unto the
court till I have seen it more openly than it hath been seen here;
and if I may not speed I shall return again as he that may not be
against the will of our Lord Jesu Christ. When they of the Table
Round heard Sir Gawaine say so, they arose up the most part and
made such avows as Sir Gawaine had made. Anon as King Arthur
heard this he was greatly displeased, for he wist well they might
not again say their avows. Alas, said King Arthur unto Sir Gawaine, ye have nigh slain me with the avow and promise that ye
have made; for through you ye have bereft me the fairest fellowship
and the truest of knighthood that ever were seen together in any realm of the world; for when they depart from hence I am sure they all shall never meet more in this world, for they shall die many
in the quest. And so it forthinketh me a little, for I have loved them as well as my life, wherefore it shall grieve me right sore, the departition of this fellowship: for I have had an old custom to have them in my fellowship.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
      <h3>HOW GREAT SORROW WAS MADE OF THE KING AND THE QUEEN AND LADIES FOR THE DEPARTING OF THE KNIGHTS, AND HOW THEY DEPARTED</h3>

      <p>
        And therewith the tears filled in his eyes. And then he said: Gawaine, Gawaine, ye have set me in great sorrow, for I have great
doubt that my true fellowship shall never meet here more again.
Ah, said Sir Launcelot, comfort yourself; for it shall be unto us a great honour and much more than if we died in any other places, for of death we be siccar. Ah, Launcelot, said the king, the great love that I have had unto you all the days of my life maketh me
to say such doleful words; for never Christian king had never so many worthy men at his table as I have had this day at the Round
Table, and that is my great sorrow. When the queen, ladies, and
gentlewomen, wist these tidings, they had such sorrow and heaviness
that there might no tongue tell it, for those knights had held them
in honour and charity. But among all other Queen Guenever made
great sorrow. I marvel, said she, my lord would suffer them to depart from him. Thus was all the court troubled for the love of the
departition of those knights. And many of those ladies that loved
knights would have gone with their lovers; and so had they done,
had not an old knight come among them in religious clothing; and
then he spake all on high and said: Fair lords, which have sworn in the quest of the Sangreal, thus sendeth you Nacien, the hermit,
word, that none in this quest lead lady nor gentlewoman with him,
for it is not to do in so high a service as they labour in; for I warn
you plain, he that is not clean of his sins he shall not see the mysteries
of our Lord Jesu Christ. And for this cause they left these ladies and
gentlewomen. After this the queen came unto Galahad and asked
him of whence he was, and of what country. He told her of whence
he was. And son unto Launcelot, she said he was. As to that, he
said neither yea or nay. So God me help, said the queen, of your father ye need not to shame you, for he is the goodliest knight, and
of the best men of the world come, and of the strain of all parties, of kings. Wherefore ye ought of right to be, of your deeds, a passing good man; and certainly, she said, ye resemble him much. Then
Sir Galahad was a little ashamed and said: Madam, sith ye know in
certain, wherefore do ye ask it me? for he that is my father shall be
known openly and all betimes. And then they went to rest them.
And in the honour of the highness of Galahad he was led into King Arthur's chamber, and there rested in his own bed. And as soon as it was day the king arose, for he had no rest of all that night for sorrow. Then he went unto Gawaine and to Sir Launcelot
that were arisen for to hear mass. And then the king again
said: Ah Gawaine, Gawaine, ye have betrayed me; for never shall my court be amended by you, but ye will never be sorry for me as
I am for you. And therewith the tears began to run down by his
visage. And therewith the king said: Ah, knight Sir Launcelot, I require thee thou counsel me, for I would that this quest were
undone an it might be. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, ye saw yesterday so many worthy knights that then were sworn that they may not leave
it in no manner of wise. That wot I well, said the king, but it shall
so heavy me at their departing that I wot well there shall no manner
of joy remedy me. And then the king and the queen went unto the
minister. So anon Launcelot and Gawaine commanded their men
to bring their arms. And when they all were armed save their
shields and their helms, then they came to their fellowship, which
were all ready in the same wise, for to go to the minster to hear
their service. Then after the service was done the king would wit
how many had undertaken the quest of the Holy Grail; and to account them he prayed them all. Then found they by tale an hundred and fifty, and all were knights of the Round Table. And
then they put on their helms and departed, and recommended them
all wholly unto the queen: and there was weeping and great sorrow. Then the queen departed into her chamber so that no man should
apperceive her great sorrows. When Sir Launcelot missed the queen
he went into her chamber, and when she saw him she cried aloud:
O Sir Launcelot, ye have betrayed me and put me to death, for to leave thus my lord. Ah, madam, said Sir Launcelot, I pray you be not displeased, for I shall come as soon as I may with my worship.
Alas, said she, that ever I saw you; but he that suffered death upon
the cross for all mankind be to you good conduct and safety, and all the whole fellowship. Right so departed Sir Launcelot, and found
his fellowship that abode his coming. And so they mounted upon
their horses and rode through the streets of Camelot; and there was
weeping of the rich and poor, and the king turned away and might
not speak for weeping. So within a while they came to a city, and a
castle that hight Vagon. There they entered into the castle, and
the lord of that castle was an old man that hight Vagon, and he was a good man of his living, and set open the gates, and made them
all the good cheer that he might. And so on the morrow they were
all accorded that they should depart every each from other; and then
they departed on the morrow with weeping and mourning cheer,
and every knight took the way that him best liked.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
      <h3>HOW GALAHAD GAT HIM A SHIELD, AND HOW THEY SPED THAT PRESUMED
TO TAKE DOWN THE SAID SHIELD</h3>

      <p>
        Now rideth Sir Galahad yet without shield, and so he rode four
days without any adventure. And at the fourth day after evensong
he came to a White Abbey, and there he was received with great
reverence, and led to a chamber, and there he was unarmed; and then was he ware of two knights of the Round Table, one was King
Bagdemagus, and that other was Sir Uwaine. And when they saw him they went unto him and made of him great solace, and so they
went to supper. Sirs, said Sir Galahad, what adventure brought you
hither? Sir, said they, it is told us that within this place is a shield
that no man may bear about his neck but if that he be mischieved
or dead within three days, or else maimed for ever. Ah sir, said King
Bagdemagus, I shall it bear tomorrow for to essay this strange
adventure. In the name of God, said Sir Galahad. Sir, said Bagdemagus,
an I may not achieve the adventure of this shield ye shall take it upon you, for I am sure ye shall not fail. Sir, said Galahad, I agree right well thereto, for I have no shield. So on the morn they
arose and heard mass. Then King Bagdemagus asked where the adventurous shield was. Anon a monk led him behind an altar where the shield hung as white as any snow, but in the middes was a red cross. Sir, said the monk, this shield ought not to be hanged
about no knight's neck but he be the worthiest knight of the world,
and therefore I counsel you knights to be well advised. Well, said King Bagdemagus, I wot well that I am not the best knight of the world, but yet shall I essay to bear it. And so he bare it out of the monastery; and then he said unto Sir Galahad: If it will please you
I pray you abide here still, till ye know how I shall speed. I shall abide you here, said Galahad. Then King Bagdemagus took with
him a squire, the which should bring tidings unto Sir Galahad how
he sped. Then when they had ridden a two mile and came in a fair valley afore an hermitage, then they saw a goodly knight come from
that part in white armour, horse and all; and he came as fast as his horse might run, with his spear in the rest, and King Bagdemagus
dressed his spear against him and brake it upon the white knight.
But the other struck him so hard that he brake the mails, and thrust him through the right shoulder, for the shield covered him not as
at that time; and so he bare him from his horse. And therewith he
alighted and took the white shield from him, saying: Knight, thou
hast done thyself great folly, for this shield ought not to be borne but
by him that shall have no peer that liveth. And then he came to King Bagdemagus' squire and said: Bear this shield unto the good
knight Sir Galahad, that thou left in the abbey, and greet him well
from me. Sir, said the squire, what is your name? Take thou no
heed of my name, said the knight, for it is not for thee to know nor
for none earthly man. Now, fair sir, said the squire, at the reverence
of Jesu Christ, tell me for what cause this shield may not be borne
but if the bearer thereof be mischieved. Now sith thou hast conjured
me so, said the knight, this shield behoveth unto no man but unto
Galahad. And the squire went unto Bagdemagus and asked whether
he were sore wounded or not. Yea, forsooth, said he, I shall escape hard from the death. Then he fetched his horse, and brought him
with great pain unto an abbey. Then was he taken down softly and unarmed, and laid in a bed, and there was looked to his wounds.
And as the book telleth, he lay there long, and escaped hard with
the life.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
      <h3>HOW GALAHAD DEPARTED WITH THE SHIELD, AND HOW KING EVELAKE HAD RECEIVED THE SHIELD OF JOSEPH OF ARAMATHIE</h3>

      <p>
        Sir Galahad, said the squire, that knight that wounded Bagdemagus
sendeth you greeting, and bad that ye should bear this
shield, wherethrough great adventures should befall. Now blessed be God and fortune, said Galahad. And then he asked his arms, and
mounted upon his horse, and hung the white shield about his neck,
and commended them unto God. And Sir Uwaine said he would
bear him fellowship if it pleased him. Sir, said Galahad, that may
ye not, for I must go alone, save this squire shall bear me fellowship:
and so departed Uwaine. Then within a while came Galahad there
as the white knight abode him by the hermitage, and every each
saluted other courteously. Sir, said Galahad, by this shield be many
marvels fallen? Sir, said the knight, it befell after the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ thirty-two year, that Joseph of Aramathie, the gentle knight, the which took down our Lord off the holy Cross, at that time he departed from Jerusalem with a great party of his kindred with him. And so he laboured till that they came to a city that hight Sarras. And at that same hour that Joseph came to Sarras there was a king that hight Evelake, that had great war against
the Saracens, and in especial against one Saracen, the which was King Evelake's cousin, a rich king and a mighty, which marched
nigh this land, and his name was called Tolleme la Feintes. So on
a day these two met to do battle. Then Joseph, the son of Joseph of Aramathie, went to King Evelake and told him he should be discomfit and slain, but if he left his belief of the old law and believed upon the new law. And then there he shewed him the right belief of the Holy Trinity, to the which he agreed unto with all his heart;
and there this shield was made for King Evelake, in the name of Him
that died upon the Cross. And then through his good belief he had
the better of King Tolleme. For when Evelake was in the battle there was a cloth set afore the shield, and when he was in the
greatest peril he let put away the cloth, and then his enemies saw
a figure of a man on the Cross, wherethrough they all were discomfit. And so it befell that a man of King Evelake's was smitten
his hand off, and bare that hand in his other hand; and Joseph called that man unto him and bade him go with good devotion touch the
Cross. And as soon as that man had touched the Cross with his hand it was as whole as ever it was tofore. Then soon after there fell a great marvel, that the cross of the shield at one time vanished away
that no man wist where it became. And then King Evelake was
baptised, and for the most part all the people of that city. So, soon
after Joseph would depart, and King Evelake would go with him
whether he would or nold. And so by fortune they came into this
land, that at that time was called Great Britain; and there they
found a great felon paynim, that put Joseph into prison. And so by
fortune tidings came unto a worthy man that hight Mondrames,
and he assembled all his people for the great renown he had heard
of Joseph; and so he came into the land of Great Britain and disinherited this felon paynim and consumed him; and therewith
delivered Joseph out of prison. And after that all the people were
turned to the Christian faith.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
      <h3>HOW JOSEPH MADE A CROSS ON THE WHITE SHIELD WITH HIS BLOOD,
AND HOW GALAHAD WAS BY A MONK BROUGHT TO A TOMB</h3>

      <p>
        Not long after that Joseph was laid in his deadly bed. And when
King Evelake saw that he made much sorrow, and said: For thy love
I have left my country, and sith ye shall depart out of this world,
leave me some token of yours that I may think on you. Joseph said:
That will I do full gladly; now bring me your shield that I took you
when ye went into battle against King Tolleme. Then Joseph bled
sore at the nose, so that he might not by no mean be staunched.
And there upon that shield he made a cross of his own blood. Now
may ye see a remembrance that I love you, for ye shall never see
this shield but ye shall think on me, and it shall be always as fresh as it is now. And never shall man bear this shield about his neck but
he shall repent it, unto the time that Galahad, the good knight, bare
it; and the last of my lineage shall have it about his neck, that shall do
many marvellous deeds. Now, said King Evelake, where shall I put this shield, that this worthy knight may have it? Ye shall leave
it there as Nacien, the hermit, shall be put after his death; for thither
shall that good knight come the fifteenth day after that he shall receive the order of knighthood: and so that day that they set is this time that he have his shield, and in the same abbey lieth Nacien, the hermit. And then the white knight vanished away. Anon as the squire had heard these words, he alit off his hackney and kneeled
down at Galahad's feet, and prayed him that he might go with
him till he had made him knight. If I would not refuse you? Then
will ye make me a knight? said the squire, and that order, by the
grace of God, shall be well set in me. So Sir Galahad granted him,
and turned again unto the abbey where they came from; and there men made great joy of Sir Galahad. And anon as he was alit there was a monk brought him unto a tomb in a churchyard, where there was such a noise that who that heard it should verily nigh be mad or
lose his strength: and Sir, they said, we deem it is a fiend.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
      <h3>OF THE MARVEL THAT SIR GALAHAD SAW AND HEARD IN THE TOMB,
AND HOW HE MADE MELIAS KNIGHT</h3>

      <p>
        Now lead me thither, said Galahad. And so they did, all armed
save his helm. Now, said the good man, go to the tomb and lift it up. So he did, and heard a great noise; and piteously it said, that all men might hear it: Sir Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, come
thou not nigh me, for thou shah make me go again there where I have been so long. But Galahad was nothing afraid, but lifted up
the stone; and there came out so foul a smoke, and after he saw the
foulest figure leap thereout that ever he saw in the likeness of a man; and then he blessed him and wist well it was a fiend. Then
heard he a voice say: Galahad, I see there environ about thee so many angels that my power may not dare thee. Right so Sir Galahad saw a body all armed lie in that tomb, and beside him a sword. Now,
fair brother, said Galahad, let us remove this body, for it is not worthy
to lie in this churchyard, for he was a false Christian man. And
therewith they all departed and went to the abbey. And anon as he was unarmed a good man came and set him down by him and said:
Sir, I shall tell you what betokeneth all that ye saw in the tomb; for
that covered body betokeneth the duresse of the world, and the great
sin that our Lord found in the world. For there was such wretchedness
that the father loved not the son, nor the son loved not the
father; and that was one of the causes that our Lord took flesh and
blood of a clene maiden, for our sins were so great at that time that wellnigh all was wickedness. Truly, said Galahad, I believe you right
well. So Sir Galahad rested him there that night; and upon the morn he made the squire knight, and asked him his name, and of
what kindred he was come. Sir, said he, men calleth me Melias de
Lile, and I am the son of the king of Denmark. Now, fair sir, said Galahad, sith that ye become of kings and queens, now look that knighthood be well set in you, for ye ought to be a mirror unto all
chivalry. Sir, said Sir Melias, ye say sooth. But, sir, sithen ye have
made me a knight ye must of right grant me my first desire that is reasonable. Ye say sooth, said Galahad. Melias said: Then that ye
will suffer me to ride with you in this quest of the Sangreal, till
that some adventure depart us. I grant you, sir. Then men brought
Sir Melias his armour and his spear and his horse, and so Sir Galahad
and he rode forth all that week or they found any adventure. And
then upon a Monday in the morning, as they were departed from an
abbey, they came to a cross which departed two ways, and in that
cross were letters written that said thus: Now, ye knights errant, the which goeth to seek knights adventurous, see here two ways; that one way defendeth thee that thou ne go that way, for he shall not go out of the way again but if he be a good man and a worthy
knight; and if thou go on the left hand, thou shalt not lightly there win prowess, for thou shalt in this way be soon essayed. Sir, said Melias to Galahad, if it like you to suffer me to take the way on the
left hand, tell me, for there I shall well prove my strength. It were better, said Galahad, ye rode not that way, for I deem I should better escape in that way than ye. Nay, my lord, I pray you let me have that adventure. Take it in God's name, said Galahad.
      </p>

      <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
      <h3>OF THE ADVENTURE THAT MELIAS HAD, AND HOW GALAHAD REVENGED HIM,
AND HOW MELIAS WAS CARRIED INTO AN ABBEY</h3>

      <p>
        And then rode Melias into an old forest, and therein he rode two
days and more. And then he came into a fair meadow, and there was a fair lodge of boughs. And then he espied in that lodge a
chair, wherein was a crown of gold, subtily wrought. Also there were cloths covered upon the earth, and many delicious meats
set thereon. Sir Melias beheld this adventure, and thought it marvellous,
but he had no hunger, but of the crown of gold he took
much keep; and therewith he stooped down and took it up, and
rode his way with it. And anon he saw a knight came riding after him that said: Knight, set down that crown which is not yours, and
therefore defend you. Then Sir Melias blessed him and said: Fair
lord of heaven, help and save thy newmade knight. And then they
let their horses run as fast as they might, so that the other knight
smote Sir Melias through hauberk and through the left side, that he fell to the earth nigh dead. And then he took the crown and went
his way; and Sir Melias lay still and had no power to stir. In the meanwhile by fortune there came Sir Galahad and found him there in peril of death. And then he said: Ah, Melias, who hath wounded
you? therefore it had been better to have ridden the other way. And
when Sir Melias heard him speak: Sir, he said, for God's love let me not die in this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here beside, that
I may be confessed and have my rights. It shall be done, said Galahad,
but where is he that hath wounded you? With that Sir Galahad
heard in the leaves cry on high: Knight, keep thee from me. Ah sir, said Melias, beware, for that is he that hath slain me. Sir Galahad
answered: Sir knight, come on your peril. Then either dressed to other, and came together as fast as their horses might run, and Galahad
smote him so that his spear went through his shoulder, and smote him down off his horse, and in the falling Galahad's spear brake. With that came out another knight out of the leaves, and brake a
spear upon Galahad or ever he might turn him. Then Galahad
drew out his sword and smote off the left arm of him, so that it
fell to the earth. And then he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast
after him. And then he turned again unto Sir Melias, and there he
alit and dressed him softly on his horse tofore him, for the truncheon
of his spear was in his body; and Sir Galahad start up behind him,
and held him in his arms, and so brought him to the abbey, and
there unarmed him and brought him to his chamber. And then he
asked his Saviour. And when he had received Him he said unto
Sir Galahad: Sir, let death come when it pleaseth him. And therewith he drew out the truncheon of the spear out of his body: and
then he swooned. Then came there an old monk which sometime
had been a knight, and beheld Sir Melias. And anon he ransacked
him; and then he said unto Sir Galahad: I shall heal him of his wound, by the grace of God, within the term of seven weeks. Then
was Sir Galahad glad, and unarmed him, and said he would abide
there three days. And then he asked Sir Melias how it stood with
him. Then he said he was turned unto helping, God be thanked.
