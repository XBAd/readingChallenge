          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benvenuto_Cellini#Autobiography" target="_blank">The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</a>
          was started in the year 1558 at the age of 58 and ended abruptly just
          before his last trip to Pisa around the year 1563 when Cellini was
          approximately 63 years old. Benvenuto Cellini (3 November 1500 – 13 February 1571)
          was an Italian goldsmith, sculptor, draftsman, soldier, musician,
          and artist who also wrote poetry. He was one of the most important
          artists of Mannerism. He is remembered for his skill in making pieces
          such as the <em>Cellini Salt Cellar</em> and <em>Perseus with the Head of Medusa</em>.
          His memoirs give a detailed account of
          his singular career, as well as his loves, hatreds, passions, and
          delights, written in an energetic, direct, and racy style;
          as one critic wrote, "Other goldsmiths have done finer work,
          but Benvenuto Cellini is the author of the most delightful
          autobiography ever written."
          Cellini's writing shows a great self-regard and
          self-assertion, sometimes running into extravagances
          which are impossible to credit.

      <h2>XXXIV</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he whole world was now in warfare</span>. Pope Clement had sent to get some troops from Giovanni de’ Medici, and when they came, they made such disturbances in Rome, that it was ill living in open shops. On this account I retired to a good snug house behind the Banchi, where I worked for all the friends I had acquired. Since I produced few things of much importance at that period, I need not waste time in talking about them. I took much pleasure in music and amusements of the kind. On the death of Giovanni de’ Medici in Lombardy, the Pope, at the advice of Messer Jacopo Salviati, dismissed the five bands he had engaged; and when the Constable of Bourbon knew there were no troops in Rome, he pushed his army with the utmost energy up to the city. The whole of Rome upon this flew to arms. I happened to be intimate with Alessandro, the son of Piero del Bene, who, at the time when the Colonnesi entered Rome, had requested me to guard his palace. On this more serious occasion, therefore, he prayed me to enlist fifty comrades for the protection of the said house, appointing me their captain, as I had been when the Colonnesi came. So I collected fifty young men of the highest courage, and we took up our quarters in his palace, with good pay and excellent appointments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bourbon’s army had now arrived before the walls of Rome, and Alessandro begged me to go with him to <span class="tooltip">reconnoitre<span class="tooltiptext">make a military observation of (a region); to engage in reconnaissance</span></span>. So we went with one of the stoutest fellows in our Company; and on the way a youth called Cecchino della Casa joined himself to us. On reaching the walls by the Campo Santo, we could see that famous army, which was making every effort to enter the town. Upon the <span class="tooltip">ramparts<span class="tooltiptext">a defensive wall of a castle or walled city, having a broad top with a walkway and typically a stone parapet.</span></span> where we took our station several young men were lying killed by the besiegers; the battle raged there desperately, and there was the densest fog imaginable. I turned to Alessandro and said: “Let us go home as soon as we can, for there is nothing to be done here; you see the enemies are mounting, and our men are in flight.” Alessandro, in a panic, cried: “Would God that we had never come here!” and turned in maddest haste to fly. I took him up somewhat sharply with these words: “Since you have brought me here, I must perform some action worthy of a man;” and directing my <span class="tooltip">arquebuse<span class="tooltiptext">small-caliber long gun operated by a matchlock or wheel-lock mechanism, dating from about 1400.</span></span> where I saw the thickest and most <span class="tooltip">serried<span class="tooltiptext">(of rows of people or things) standing close together; crowded or pressed together</span></span> troop of fighting men, I aimed exactly at one whom I remarked to be higher than the rest; the fog prevented me from being certain whether he was on horseback or on foot. Then I turned to Alessandro and Cecchino, and bade them discharge their arquebuses, showing them how to avoid being hit by the besiegers. When we had fired two rounds apiece, I crept cautiously up to the wall, and observing among the enemy a most extraordinary confusion, I discovered afterwards that one of our shots had killed the Constable of Bourbon; and from what I subsequently learned, he was the man whom I had first noticed above the heads of the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quitting our position on the ramparts, we crossed the Campo Santo, and entered the city by St. Peter’s; then coming out exactly at the church of Santo Agnolo, we got with the greatest difficulty to the great gate of the castle; for the generals Renzo di Ceri and Orazio Baglioni were wounding and slaughtering everybody who abandoned the defence of the walls. By the time we had reached the great gate, part of the <span class="tooltip">foemen<span class="tooltiptext">foes; adversaries</span></span> had already entered Rome, and we had them in our rear. The <span class="tooltip">castellan<span class="tooltiptext">the governor of a castle.</span></span> had ordered the <span class="tooltip">portcullis<span class="tooltiptext">a heavy vertically-closing gate typically found in Medieval fortifications</span></span> to be lowered, in order to do which they cleared a little space, and this enabled us four to get inside. On the instant that I entered, the captain Pallone de’ Medici claimed me as being of the Papal household, and forced me to abandon Alessandro, which I had to do, much against my will. I ascended to the keep, and at the same instant Pope Clement came in through the corridors into the castle; he had refused to leave the palace of St. Peter earlier, being unable to believe that his enemies would effect their entrance into Rome. Having got into the castle in this way, I attached myself to certain pieces of artillery, which were under the command of a bombardier called Giuliano Fiorentino. Leaning there against the battlements, the unhappy man could see his poor house being sacked, and his wife and children outraged; fearing to strike his own folk, he dared not discharge the cannon, and flinging the burning fuse upon the ground, he wept as though his heart would break, and tore his cheeks with both his hands. Some of the other bombardiers were behaving in like manner; seeing which, I took one of the matches, and got the assistance of a few men who were not overcome by their emotions. I aimed some swivels and <span class="tooltip">falconets<span class="tooltiptext">a very small cannon used in the 16th and 17th centuries</span></span> at points where I saw it would be useful, and killed with them a good number of the enemy. Had it not been for this, the troops who poured into Rome that morning, and were marching straight upon the castle, might possibly have entered it with ease, because the artillery was doing them no damage. I went on firing under the eyes of several cardinals and lords, who kept blessing me and giving me the heartiest encouragement. In my enthusiasm I strove to achieve the impossible; let it suffice that it was I who saved the castle that morning, and brought the other bombardiers back to their duty. I worked hard the whole of that day; and when the evening came, while the army was marching into Rome through the Trastevere, Pope Clement appointed a great Roman nobleman named Antonio Santacroce to be captain of all the gunners. The first thing this man did was to come to me, and having greeted me with the utmost kindness, he stationed me with five fine pieces of artillery on the highest point of the castle, to which the name of the Angel specially belongs. This circular eminence goes round the castle, and surveys both Prati and the town of Rome. The captain put under my orders enough men to help in managing my guns, and having seen me paid in advance, he gave me rations of bread and a little wine, and begged me to go forward as I had begun. I was perhaps more inclined by nature to the profession of arms than to the one I had adopted, and I took such pleasure in its duties that I discharged them better than those of my own art. Night came, the enemy had entered Rome, and we who were in the castle (especially myself, who have always taken pleasure in extraordinary sights) stayed gazing on the indescribable scene of tumult and <span class="tooltip">conflagration<span class="tooltiptext">fire; conflict; war</span></span> in the streets below. People who were anywhere else but where we were, could not have formed the least imagination of what it was. I will not, however, set myself to describe that tragedy, but will content myself with continuing the history of my own life and the circumstances which properly belong to it.
