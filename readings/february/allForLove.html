        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_for_Love_(play)" target="_blank"><em>All for Love; or, the World Well Lost</em></a>,
          is a 1677 heroic drama by John Dryden which is now his best-known and
          most performed play. It is a tragedy written in blank verse and is an
          attempt on Dryden's part to reinvigorate serious drama. It is an acknowledged
          imitation of Shakespeare’s <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, and focuses on the
          last hours of the lives of its hero and heroine. Although it ostensibly
          deals with the same topic as Shakespeare's <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>,
          Dryden confines the action to Alexandria and focuses on the end of their
          doomed relationship. It first appeared in 1677, was revived in 1704
          and performed 123 times between 1700-1800, becoming the preferred
          version of the story; Shakespeare's play did not reappear on the
          London stage until 1813.

      <h2>Act III</h2>

      <p>
        At one door enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMION, IRAS, and ALEXAS, a Train of Egyptians: at the other ANTONY and Romans. The entrance on both sides is prepared by music; the trumpets first sounding on ANTONY’S part: then answered by timbrels, etc., on CLEOPATRA’S. CHARMION and IRAS hold a laurel wreath betwixt them. A Dance of Egyptians. After the ceremony, CLEOPATRA crowns ANTONY.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I thought how those white arms would fold me in, <br>
       And strain me close, and melt me into love;<br>
       So pleased with that sweet image, I sprung forwards,<br>
       And added all my strength to every blow.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Come to me, come, my soldier, to my arms!<br>
      You’ve been too long away from my embraces;<br>
      But, when I have you fast, and all my own,<br>
      With broken murmurs, and with amorous sighs,<br>
      I’ll say, you were unkind, and punish you,<br>
      And mark you red with many an eager kiss.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  My brighter Venus!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  O my greater Mars!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Thou join’st us well, my love!<br>
      Suppose me come from the Phlegræan plains,<br>
      Where gasping giants lay, cleft by my sword,<br>
      And mountain-tops paired off each other blow,<br>
      To bury those I slew. Receive me, goddess!<br>
      Let Cæsar spread his subtle nets; like <span class="tooltip">Vulcan<span class="tooltiptext">the god of fire including the fire of volcanoes, deserts, metalworking, and the forge in ancient Roman religion and myth. He is often depicted with a blacksmith's hammer</span></span>,<br>
      In thy embraces I would be beheld<br>
      By heaven and earth at once;<br>
      And make their envy what they meant their sport?<br>
      Let those, who took us, blush; I would love on,<br>
      With awful state, regardless of their frowns,<br>
      As their superior gods.<br>
      There’s no satiety of love in thee:<br>
      Enjoyed, thou still art new; perpetual spring<br>
      Is in thy arms; the ripened fruit but falls,<br>
      And blossoms rise to fill its empty place;<br>
      And I grow rich by giving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter VENTIDIUS, and stands apart
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  Oh, now the danger’s past, your general comes!<br>
      He joins not in your joys, nor minds your triumphs;<br>
      But, with contracted brows, looks frowning on,<br>
      As envying your success.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Now, on my soul, he loves me; truly loves me:<br>
      He never flattered me in any vice,<br>
      But awes me with his virtue: even this minute<br>
      Methinks, he has a right of chiding me.<br>
      Lead to the temple: I’ll avoid his presence;<br>
      It checks too strong upon me.  [Exeunt the rest.]  [As ANTONY is going, VENTIDIUS pulls him by the robe.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Emperor!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  ’Tis the old argument; I pr’ythee, spare me.  [Looking back.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  But this one hearing, emperor.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Let go<br>
      My robe; or, by my father Hercules—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  By Hercules’ father, that’s yet greater,<br>
      I bring you somewhat you would wish to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Thou see’st we are observed; attend me here,<br>
      And I’ll return.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  I am waning in his favour, yet I love him;<br>
      I love this man, who runs to meet his ruin;<br>
      And sure the gods, like me, are fond of him:<br>
      His virtues lie so mingled with his crimes,<br>
      As would confound their choice to punish one,<br>
      And not reward the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter ANTONY
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  We can conquer,<br>
      You see, without your aid.<br>
      We have dislodged their troops;<br>
      They look on us at distance, and, like curs<br>
      Scaped from the lion’s paws, they bay far off,<br>
      And lick their wounds, and faintly threaten war.<br>
      Five thousand Romans, with their faces upward,<br>
      Lie breathless on the plain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  ’Tis well; and he,<br>
      Who lost them, could have spared ten thousand more.<br>
      Yet if, by this advantage, you could gain<br>
      An easier peace, while Cæsar doubts the chance<br>
      Of arms—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Oh, think not on’t, Ventidius!<br>
      The boy pursues my ruin, he’ll no peace;<br>
      His malice is considerable in advantage.<br>
      Oh, he’s the coolest murderer! so staunch,<br>
      He kills, and keeps his temper.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Have you no friend<br>
      In all his army, who has power to move him?<br>
      Mæcenas, or Agrippa, might do much
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  They’re both too deep in Cæsar’s interests.<br>
      We’ll work it out by dint of sword, or perish.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  <span class="tooltip">Fain<span class="tooltiptext">with pleasure; gladly.</span></span> I would find some other.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Thank thy love.<br>
      Some four or five such victories as this<br>
      Will save thy further pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Expect no more; Cæsar is on his guard:<br>
      I know, sir, you have conquered against odds;<br>
      But still you draw supplies from one poor town,<br>
      And of Egyptians: he has all the world,<br>
      And, at his beck, nations come pouring in,<br>
      To fill the gaps you make. Pray, think again.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Why dost thou drive me from myself, to search<br>
      For foreign aids?—to hunt my memory,<br>
      And range all o’er a waste and barren place,<br>
      To find a friend? The wretched have no friends.<br>
      Yet I had one, the bravest youth of Rome,<br>
      Whom Cæsar loves beyond the love of women:<br>
      He could resolve his mind, as fire does wax,<br>
      From that hard rugged image melt him down,<br>
      And mould him in what softer form he pleased.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Him would I see; that man, of all the world;<br>
      Just such a one we want.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  He love me too;<br>
      I was his soul; he lived not but in me:<br>
      We were so closed within each other’s breasts,<br>
      The rivets were not found, that joined us first.<br>
      That does not reach us yet: we were so mixt,<br>
      As meeting streams, both to ourselves were lost;<br>
      We were one mass; we could not give or take,<br>
      But from the same; for he was I, I he.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  He moves as I would wish him.  [Aside.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  After this,<br>
      I need not tell his name;—’twas Dolabella.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  He’s now in Cæsar’s camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  No matter where,<br>
      Since he’s no longer mine. He took unkindly,<br>
      That I forbade him Cleopatra’s sight,<br>
      Because I feared he loved her: he confessed,<br>
      He had a warmth, which, for my sake, he stifled;<br>
      For ’twere impossible that two, so one,<br>
      Should not have loved the same. When he departed,<br>
      He took no leave; and that confirmed my thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  It argues, that he loved you more than her,<br>
      Else he had stayed; but he perceived you jealous,<br>
      And would not grieve his friend: I know he loves you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I should have seen him, then, ere now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Perhaps<br>
      He has thus long been labouring for your peace.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Would he were here!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Would you believe he loved you?<br>
      I read your answer in your eyes, you would.<br>
      Not to conceal it longer, he has sent<br>
      A messenger from Cæsar’s camp, with letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Let him appear
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  I’ll bring him instantly.  [Exit VENTIDIUS, and re-enters immediately with DOLABELLA.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  ’Tis he himself! himself, by holy friendship!  [Runs to embrace him.]<br>
      Art thou returned at last, my better half?<br>
      Come, give me all myself!<br>
      Let me not live,<br>
      If the young bridegroom, longing for his night,<br>
      Was ever half so fond.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  I must be silent, for my soul is busy<br>
      About a nobler work; she’s new come home,<br>
      Like a long-absent man, and wanders o’er<br>
      Each room, a stranger to her own, to look<br>
      If all be safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Thou hast what’s left of me;<br>
      For I am now so sunk from what I was,<br>
      Thou find’st me at my lowest water-mark.<br>
      The rivers that ran in, and raised my fortunes,<br>
      Are all dried up, or take another course:<br>
      What I have left is from my native spring;<br>
      I’ve still a heart that swells, in scorn of fate,<br>
      And lifts me to my banks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Still you are lord of all the world to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Why, then I yet am so; for thou art all.<br>
      If I had any joy when thou wert absent,<br>
      I grudged it to myself; methought I robbed<br>
      Thee of thy part. But, O my Dolabella!<br>
      Thou has beheld me other than I am.<br>
      Hast thou not seen my morning chambers filled<br>
      With sceptred slaves, who waited to salute me?<br>
      With eastern monarchs, who forgot the sun,<br>
      To worship my uprising?—menial kings<br>
      Ran coursing up and down my palace-yard,<br>
      Stood silent in my presence, watched my eyes,<br>
      And, at my least command, all started out,<br>
      Like racers to the goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Slaves to your fortune.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Fortune is Cæsar’s now; and what am I?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  What you have made yourself; I will not flatter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Is this friendly done?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Yes; when his end is so, I must join with him;<br>
      Indeed I must, and yet you must not chide;<br>
      Why am I else your friend?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Take heed, young man,<br>
      How thou upbraid’st my love: The queen has eyes,<br>
      And thou too hast a soul. Canst thou remember,<br>
      When, swelled with hatred, thou beheld’st her first,<br>
      As accessary to thy brother’s death?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Spare my remembrance; ’twas a guilty day,<br>
      And still the blush hangs here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  To clear herself,<br>
      For sending him no aid, she came from Egypt.<br>
      Her galley down the silver Cydnus rowed,<br>
      The tackling silk, the streamers waved with gold;<br>
      The gentle winds were lodged in purple sails:<br>
      Her nymphs, like <span class="tooltip">Nereids<span class="tooltiptext">The Nereids were sea nymphs in Greek mythology, fifty in total, daughters of Nereus and Doris. They helped sailors on their voyages when they faced fierce storms.</span></span>, round her couch were placed;<br>
      Where she, another sea-born Venus, lay.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  No more; I would not hear it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Oh, you must!<br>
      She lay, and leant her cheek upon her hand,<br>
      And cast a look so languishingly sweet,<br>
      As if, secure of all beholder’s hearts,<br>
      Neglecting, she could take them: boys, like Cupids,<br>
      Stood fanning, with their painted wings, the winds,<br>
      That played about her face. But if she smiled<br>
      A darting glory seemed to blazed abroad,<br>
      That men’s desiring eyes were never wearied,<br>
      But hung upon the object: To soft flutes<br>
      The silver oars kept time; and while they played,<br>
      The hearing gave new pleasure to the sight;<br>
      And both to thought. ’Twas heaven, or somewhat more;<br>
      For she so charmed all hearts, that gazing crowds<br>
      Stood panting on the shore, and wanted breath<br>
      To give their welcome voice.<br>
      Then, Dolabella, where was then they soul?<br>
      Was not thy fury quite disarmed with wonder?<br>
      Didst thou not shrink behind me from those eyes<br>
      And whisper in my ear—Oh, tell her not<br>
      That I accused her with my brother’s death?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  And should my weakness be a plea for yours?<br>
      Mine was an age when love might be excused,<br>
      When kindly warmth, and when my springing youth<br>
      Made it a debt to nature. Yours—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Speak boldly.<br>
      Yours, he would say, in your declining age,<br>
      When no more heat was left but what you forced,<br>
      When all the sap was needful for the trunk,<br>
      When it went down, then you constrained the course,<br>
      And robbed from nature, to supply desire;<br>
      In you (I would not use so harsh a word)<br>
      ’Tis but plain dotage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Ha!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  ’Twas urged too home.—<br>
      But yet the loss was private, that I made;<br>
      ’Twas but myself I lost: I lost no legions;<br>
      I had no world to lose, no people’s love.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  This from a friend?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Yes, Antony, a true one;<br>
      A friend so tender, that each word I speak<br>
      Stabs my own heart, before it reach your ear.<br>
      Oh, judge me not less kind, because I chide!<br>
      To Cæsar I excuse you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  O ye gods!<br>
      Have I then lived to be excused to Cæsar?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  As to your equal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Well, he’s but my equal:<br>
      While I wear this he never shall be more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  I bring conditions from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Are they noble?<br>
      Methinks thou shouldst not bring them else; yet he<br>
      Is full of deep dissembling; knows no honour<br>
      Divided from his interest. Fate mistook him;<br>
      For nature meant him from an <span class="tooltip">usurer<span class="tooltiptext">a person who lends money at unreasonably high rates of interest.</span></span>:<br>
      He’s fit indeed to buy, not conquer kingdoms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Then, granting this,<br>
      What power was theirs, who wrought so hard a temper<br>
      To honourable terms?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I was my Dolabella, or some god.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Nor I, nor yet Mæcenas, nor Agrippa:<br>
      They were your enemies; and I, a friend,<br>
      Too weak alone; yet ’twas a Roman’s deed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  ’Twas like a Roman done: show me that man,<br>
      Who has preserved my life, my love, my honour;<br>
      Let me but see his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  That task is mine,<br>
      And, Heaven, thou know’st how pleasing.  [Exit VENT.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  You’ll remember<br>
      To whom you stand obliged?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  When I forget it<br>
      Be thou unkind, and that’s my greatest curse.<br>
      My queen shall thank him too,
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  I fear she will not.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  But she shall do it: The queen, my Dolabella!<br>
      Hast thou not still some grudgings of thy fever?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  I would not see her lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  When I forsake her,<br>
      Leave me my better stars! for she has truth<br>
      Beyond her beauty. Cæsar tempted her,<br>
      At no less price than kingdoms, to betray me;<br>
      But she resisted all: and yet thou chidest me<br>
      For loving her too well. Could I do so?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Yes; there’s my reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Re-enter VENTIDIUS, with OCTAVIA, leading ANTONY’S two little Daughters
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Where?—Octavia there!  [Starting back.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  What, is she poison to you?—a disease?<br>
      Look on her, view her well, and those she brings:<br>
      Are they all strangers to your eyes? has nature<br>
      No secret call, no whisper they are yours?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  For shame, my lord, if not for love, receive them<br>
      With kinder yes. If you confess a man,<br>
      Meet them, embrace them, bid them welcome to you.<br>
      Your arms should open, even without your knowledge,<br>
      To clasp them in; your feet should turn to wings,<br>
      To bear you to them; and your eyes dart out<br>
      And aim a kiss, ere you could reach the lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I stood amazed, to think how they came hither.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  I sent for them; I brought them in unknown<br>
      To Cleopatra’s guards.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Yet, are you cold?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Thus long I have attended for my welcome;<br>
      Which, as a stranger, sure I might expect.<br>
      Who am I?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Cæsar’s sister.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  That’s unkind.<br>
      Had I been nothing more than Cæsar’s sister,<br>
      Know, I had still remained in Cæsar’s camp:<br>
      But your Octavia, your much injured wife,<br>
      Though banished from your bed, driven from your house,<br>
      In spite of Cæsar’s sister, still is yours.<br>
      ’Tis true, I have a heart disdains your coldness,<br>
      And prompts me not to seek what you should offer;<br>
      But a wife’s virtue still surmounts that pride.<br>
      I come to claim you as my own; to show<br>
      My duty first; to ask, nay beg, your kindness:<br>
      Your hand, my lord; ’tis mine, and I will have it.  [Taking his hand.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Do, take it; thou deserv’st it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  On my soul,<br>
      And so she does: she’s neither too submissive,<br>
      Nor yet too haughty; but so just a mean<br>
      Shows, as it ought, a wife and Roman too.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I fear, Octavia, you have begged my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Begged it, my lord?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Yes, begged it, my ambassadress;<br>
      Poorly and basely begged it of your brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Poorly and basely I could never beg:<br>
      Nor could my brother grant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Shall I, who, to my kneeling slave, could say,<br>
      Rise up, and be a king; shall I fall down<br>
      And cry,—Forgive me, Cæsar! Shall I set<br>
      A man, my equal, in the place of Jove,<br>
      As he could give me being? No; that word,<br>
      Forgive, would choke me up,<br>
      And die upon my tongue.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  You shall not need it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I will not need it. Come, you’ve all betrayed me,—<br>
      My friend too!—to receive some vile conditions.<br>
      My wife has bought me, with her prayers and tears;<br>
      And now I must become her branded slave.<br>
      In every <span class="tooltip">peevish<span class="tooltiptext">easily irritated, especially by unimportant things.</span></span> mood, she will upbraid<br>
      The life she gave: if I but look awry,<br>
      She cries—I’ll tell my brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  My hard fortune<br>
      Subjects me still to your unkind mistakes.<br>
      But the conditions I have brought are such,<br>
      Your need not blush to take: I love your honour,<br>
      Because ’tis mine; it never shall be said,<br>
      Octavia’s husband was her brother’s slave.<br>
      Sir, you are free; free, even from her you loathe;<br>
      For, though my brother bargains for your love,<br>
      Makes me the price and cement of your peace,<br>
      I have a soul like yours; I cannot take<br>
      Your love as alms, nor beg what I deserve.<br>
      I’ll tell my brother we are reconciled;<br>
      He shall draw back his troops, and you shall march<br>
      To rule the East: I may be adopt at Athens;<br>
      No matter where. I never will complain,<br>
      But only keep the barren name of wife,<br>
      And rid you of the trouble.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Was ever such a strife of sullen honour!<br>
      Both scorn to be obliged.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Oh, she has touched him in the tenderest part;<br>
      See how he reddens with despite and shame,<br>
      To be outdone in generosity!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  See how he winks! how he dries up a tear,<br>
      That fain would fall!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Octavia, I have heard you, and must praise<br>
      The greatness of your soul;<br>
      But cannot yield to what you have proposed:<br>
      For I can ne’er be conquered but by love;<br>
      And you do all for duty. You would free me,<br>
      And would be dropt at Athens; was’t not so?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  It was, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Then I must be obliged<br>
      To one who loves me not; who, to herself,<br>
      May call me thankless and ungrateful man:—<br>
      I’ll not endure it; no.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  I am glad it pinches there.  [Aside.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Would you triumph o’er poor Octavia’s virtue?<br>
      That pride was all I had to bear me up;<br>
      That you might think you owed me for your life,<br>
      And owed it to my duty, not my love.<br>
      I have been injured, and my haughty soul<br>
      Could brook but ill the man who slights my bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Therefore you love me not.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Therefore, my lord,<br>
      I should not love you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  Therefore you would leave me?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  And therefore I should leave you—if I could.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Her soul’s too great, after such injuries,<br>
      To say she loves; and yet she lets you see it.<br>
      Her modesty and silence plead her cause.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  O Dolabella, which way shall I turn?<br>
      I find a secret yielding in my soul;<br>
      But Cleopatra, who would die with me,<br>
      Must she be left? Pity pleads for Octavia;<br>
      But does it not plead more for Cleopatra?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Justice and pity both plead for Octavia;<br>
      For Cleopatra, neither.<br>
      One would be ruined with you; but she first<br>
      Had ruined you: The other, you have ruined,<br>
      And yet she would preserve you.<br>
      In everything their merits are unequal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  O my distracted soul!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Sweet Heaven compose it!—<br>
      Come, come, my lord, if I can pardon you,<br>
      Methinks you should accept it. Look on these;<br>
      Are they not yours? or stand they thus neglected,<br>
      As they are mine? Go to him, children, go;<br>
      Kneel to him, take him by the hand, speak to him;<br>
      For you may speak, and he may own you too,<br>
      Without a blush; and so he cannot all<br>
      His children: go, I say, and pull him to me,<br>
      And pull him to yourselves, from that bad woman.<br>
      You, Agrippina, hang upon his arms;<br>
      And you, Antonia, clasp about his waist:<br>
      If he will shake you off, if he will dash you<br>
      Against the pavement, you must bear it, children;<br>
      For you are mine, and I was born to suffer.  [Here the Children go to him, etc.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  Was ever sight so moving?—Emperor!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  Friend!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Husband!<br>
      Both Child. Father!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  I am vanquished: take me,<br>
      Octavia; take me, children: share me all.  [Embracing them.]<br>
      I’ve been a thriftless debtor to your loves,<br>
      And run out much, in riot, from your stock;<br>
      But all shall be amended.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  O blest hour!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Dola.</em>  O happy change!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  My joy stops at my tongue;<br>
      But it has found two channels here for one,<br>
      And bubbles out above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  [to OCTAV.]. This is thy triumph; lead me where thou wilt;<br>
      Even to thy brother’s camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  All there are yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter ALEXAS hastily
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  The queen, my mistress, sir, and yours—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ant.</em>  ’Tis past.—<br>
      Octavia, you shall stay this night: To-morrow,<br>
      Cæsar and we are one.  [Exit leading OCTAVIA; DOLABELLA and the Children follow.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Vent.</em>  There’s news for you; run, my officious eunuch,<br>
      Be sure to be the first; haste forward:<br>
      Haste, my dear eunuch, haste.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  This downright fighting fool, this thick-skulled hero,<br>
      This blunt, unthinking instrument of death,<br>
      With plain dull virtue has outgone my wit.<br>
      Pleasure forsook my earliest infancy;<br>
      The luxury of others robbed my cradle,<br>
      And ravished thence the promise of a man.<br>
      Cast out from nature, disinherited<br>
      Of what her meanest children claim by kind,<br>
      Yet greatness kept me from contempt: that’s gone.<br>
      Had Cleopatra followed my advice,<br>
      Then he had been betrayed who now forsakes.<br>
      She dies for love; but she has known its joys:<br>
      Gods, is this just, that I, who know no joys,<br>
      Must die, because she loves?
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMION, IRAS, and Train
      </p>

      <p>
        O madam, I have seen what blasts my eyes!<br>
        Octavia’s here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Peace with that raven’s note.<br>
      I know it too; and now am in<br>
      The pangs of death.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  You are no more a queen;<br>
      Egypt is lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  What tell’st thou me of Egypt?<br>
      My life, my soul is lost! Octavia has him!—<br>
      O fatal name to Cleopatra’s love!<br>
      My kisses, my embraces now are hers;<br>
      While I—But thou hast seen my rival; speak,<br>
      Does she deserve this blessing? Is she fair?<br>
      Bright as a goddess? and is all perfection<br>
      Confined to her? It is. Poor I was made<br>
      Of that coarse matter, which, when she was finished,<br>
      The gods threw by for rubbish.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  She is indeed a very miracle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Death to my hopes, a miracle!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  A miracle;  [Bowing.]<br>
      I mean of goodness; for in beauty, madam,<br>
      You make all wonders cease.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  I was too rash:<br>
      Take this in part of recompense. But, oh!  [Giving a ring.]<br>
      I fear thou flatterest me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Char.</em>  She comes! she’s here!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Iras.</em>  Fly, madam, Cæsar’s sister!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Were she the sister of the thunderer Jove,<br>
      And bore her brother’s lightning in her eyes,<br>
      Thus would I face my rival.  [Meets OCTAVIA with VENTIDIUS. OCTAVIA bears up to her. Their Trains come up on either side.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  I need not ask if you are Cleopatra;<br>
      Your haughty carriage—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Shows I am a queen:<br>
      Nor need I ask you, who you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  A Roman:<br>
      A name, that makes and can unmake a queen.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Your lord, the man who serves me, is a Roman.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  He was a Roman, till he lost that name,<br>
      To be a slave in Egypt; but I come<br>
      To free him thence.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Peace, peace, my lover’s Juno.<br>
      When he grew weary of that household clog,<br>
      He chose my easier bonds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  I wonder not<br>
      Your bonds are easy: you have long been practised<br>
      In that <span class="tooltip">lascivious<span class="tooltiptext">crude and offensive, or contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior.</span></span> art: He’s not the first<br>
      For whom you spread your snares: Let Cæsar witness.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  I loved not Cæsar; ’twas but gratitude<br>
      I paid his love: The worst your malice can,<br>
      Is but to say the greatest of mankind<br>
      Has been my slave. The next, but far above him<br>
      In my esteem, is he whom law calls yours,<br>
      But whom his love made mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  I would view nearer  [Coming up close to her.]<br>
      That face, which has so long usurped my right,<br>
      To find the inevitable charms, that catch<br>
      Mankind so sure, that ruined my dear lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Oh, you do well to search; for had you known<br>
      But half these charms, you had not lost his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Far be their knowledge from a Roman lady,<br>
      Far from a modest wife! Shame of our sex,<br>
      Dost thou not blush to own those black endearments,<br>
      That make sin pleasing?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  You may blush, who want them.<br>
      If bounteous nature, if indulgent Heaven<br>
      Have given me charms to please the bravest man,<br>
      Should I not thank them? Should I be ashamed,<br>
      And not be proud? I am, that he has loved me;<br>
      And, when I love not him, Heaven change this face<br>
      For one like that.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Thou lov’st him not so well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  I love him better, and deserve him more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  You do not; cannot: You have been his ruin.<br>
      Who made him cheap at Rome, but Cleopatra?<br>
      Who made him scorned abroad, but Cleopatra?<br>
      At Actium, who betrayed him? Cleopatra.<br>
      Who made his children orphans, and poor me<br>
      A wretched widow? only Cleopatra.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Yet she, who loves him best, is Cleopatra.<br>
      If you have suffered, I have suffered more.<br>
      You bear the <span class="tooltip">specious<span class="tooltiptext">having a false look of truth or genuineness</span></span> title of a wife<br>
      To gild your cause, and draw the pitying world<br>
      To favour it: the world condemns poor me.<br>
      For I have lost my honour, lost my fame,<br>
      And stained the glory of my royal house,<br>
      And all to bear the branded name of mistress.<br>
      There wants but life, and that too I would lose<br>
      For him I love.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Octav.</em>  Be’t so, then; take thy wish.  [Exit with her Train.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  And ’tis my wish,<br>
      Now he is lost for whom alone I lived.<br>
      My sight grows dim, and every object dances,<br>
      And swims before me, in the maze of death.<br>
      My spirits, while they were opposed, kept up;<br>
      They could not sink beneath a rival’s scorn!<br>
      But now she’s gone, they faint.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Alex.</em>  Mine have had leisure<br>
      To recollect their strength, and furnish counsel,<br>
      To ruin her, who else must ruin you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cleo.</em>  Vain promiser!<br>
      Lead me, my Charmion; nay, your hand too, Iras.<br>
      My grief has weight enough to sink you both.<br>
      Conduct me to some solitary chamber,<br>
      And draw the curtains round;<br>
      Then leave me to myself, to take alone<br>
      My fill of grief:
      </p>

      <p>
        There I till death will his unkindness weep;
      </p>

      <p>
        As harmless infants moan themselves asleep.  [Exeunt.]
      </p>
