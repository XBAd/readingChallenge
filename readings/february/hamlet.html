      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene III</h2>

      <p>
        [A room in Polonius’s house]
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.  My necessaries are embark’d, farewell; <br>
      And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
      And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
      But let me hear from you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.        Do you doubt that?
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.  For Hamlet and the trifling of his favours,<br>
      Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
      A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
      Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
      The [perfume and] suppliance of a minute;<br>
      No more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.    No more but so?
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.        Think it no more:<br>
      For nature crescent does not grow alone<br>
      In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
      The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
      Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
      And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
      The virtue of his will; but you must fear,<br>
      His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;<br>
      For he himself is subject to his birth.<br>
      He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
      Carve for himself, for on his choice depends<br>
      The sanity and health of the whole state;<br>
      And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d<br>
      Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
      Whereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves you,<br>
      It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
      As he in his particular act and place<br>
      May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
      Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
      Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain<br>
      If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
      Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
      To his unmast’red importunity.<br>
      Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
      And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
      Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
      The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
      If she unmask her beauty to the moon.<br>
      Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes.<br>
      The canker galls the infants of the spring<br>
      Too oft before the buttons be disclos’d,<br>
      And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
      Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
      Be wary then, best safety lies in fear;<br>
      Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br>
      As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
      Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
      Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,<br>
      Whilst, like a puff’d and reckless libertine,<br>
      Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
      And recks not his own rede.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.        O, fear me not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter POLONIUS
      </p>

      <p>
        I stay too long: but here my father comes.<br>
        A double blessing is a double grace;<br>
        Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
      The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
      And you are stay’d for. There; my blessing with you!<br>
      And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
      See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
      Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.<br>
      Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
      The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
      Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
      But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
      Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware<br>
      Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,<br>
      Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
      Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;<br>
      Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgement.<br>
      Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
      But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
      For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
      And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
      Are most select and generous in that.<br>
      Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
      For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
      And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
      This above all: to thine own self be true,<br>
      And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
      Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
      Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.  Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.  Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well<br>
      What I have said to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.        ’Tis in my memory lock’d,<br>
      And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Laer.  Farewell.  Exit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  Marry, well bethought.<br>
      ’Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br>
      Given private time to you, and you yourself<br>
      Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.<br>
      If it be so—as so ’tis put on me,<br>
      And that in way of caution—I must tell you,<br>
      You do not understand yourself so clearly<br>
      As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br>
      What is between you? Give me up the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br>
      Of his affection to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  Affection! pooh! You speak like a green girl,<br>
      Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br>
      Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  Marry, I’ll teach you: think yourself a baby<br>
      That you have ta’en his tenders for true pay,<br>
      Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,<br>
      Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br>
      Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  My lord, he hath importun’d me with love<br>
      In honourable fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,<br>
      With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pol.  Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br>
      When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>
      Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,<br>
      Giving more light than heat, extinct in both<br>
      Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br>
      You must not take for fire. From this time, daughter,<br>
      Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence.<br>
      Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br>
      Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br>
      Believe so much in him, that he is young,<br>
      And with a larger tether may he walk<br>
      Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,<br>
      Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br>
      Not of that dye which their investments show,<br>
      But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br>
      Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br>
      The better to beguile. This is for all:<br>
      I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br>
      Have you so slander any moment leisure<br>
      As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br>
      Look to ’t, I charge you. Come your ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oph.  I shall obey, my lord.  Exeunt.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene IV</h2>

      <p>
        [The platform]
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  It is a nipping and an eager air.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  What hour now?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        I think it lacks of twelve.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.  No, it is struck.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Indeed? I heard it not. Then it draws near the season<br>
      Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.  A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off[within].<br>
      What does this mean, my lord?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,<br>
      Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;<br>
      And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,<br>
      The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out<br>
      The triumph of his pledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        Is it a custom?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Ay, marry, is ’t,<br>
      But to my mind, though I am native here<br>
      And to the manner born, it is a custom<br>
      More honour’d in the breach than the observance.<br>
      [This heavy-headed revel east and west<br>
      Makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations.<br>
      They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br>
      Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br>
      From our achievements, though perform’d at height,<br>
      The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br>
      So, oft it chances in particular men,<br>
      That for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br>
      As, in their birth—wherein they are not guilty,<br>
      Since nature cannot choose his origin—<br>
      By their o’ergrowth of some complexion<br>
      Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br>
      Or by some habit that too much o’er-leavens<br>
      The form of plausive manners, that these men,<br>
      Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<br>
      Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star,—<br>
      His virtues else—be they as pure as grace,<br>
      As infinite as man may undergo—<br>
      Shall in the general censure take corruption<br>
      From that particular fault. The dram of eale<br>
      Doth all the noble substance often dout<br>
      To his own scandal.]
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter Ghost
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Look, my lord, it comes!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Angels and ministers of grace defend us!<br>
      Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d,<br>
      Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,<br>
      Be thy intents wicked or charitable,<br>
      Thou com’st in such a questionable shape<br>
      That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet,<br>
      King, father; royal Dane, O, answer me!<br>
      Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell<br>
      Why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death,<br>
      Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,<br>
      Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,<br>
      Hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws,<br>
      To cast thee up again. What may this mean,<br>
      That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel<br>
      Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,<br>
      Making night hideous, and we fools of nature<br>
      So horridly to shake our disposition<br>
      With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?<br>
      Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?  Ghost beckons HAMLET.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  It beckons you to go away with it,<br>
      As if it some impartment did desire<br>
      To you alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.        Look, with what courteous action<br>
      It wafts you to a more removed ground.<br>
      But do not go with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        No, by no means.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  It will not speak; then will I follow it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Do not, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        Why, what should be the fear?<br>
      I do not set my life at a pin’s fee,<br>
      And for my soul, what can it do to that,<br>
      Being a thing immortal as itself?<br>
      It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,<br>
      Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff<br>
      That beetles o’er his base into the sea,<br>
      And there assume some other horrible form,<br>
      Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason<br>
      And draw you into madness? Think of it.<br>
      [The very place puts toys of desperation,<br>
      Without more motive, into every brain<br>
      That looks so many fathoms to the sea<br>
      And hears it roar beneath.]
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        It wafts me still.<br>
      Go on, I’ll follow thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.  You shall not go, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        Hold off your hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Be rul’d; you shall not go.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        My fate cries out,<br>
      And makes each petty artery in this body<br>
      As hardly as the Nemean lion’s nerve.<br>
      Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.<br>
      By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!<br>
      I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.  Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  He waxes desperate with imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.  Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Have after. To what issue will this come?
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Heaven will direct it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.        Nay, let’s follow him.  Exeunt.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene V</h2>

      <p>
        [Another part of the platform]
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter Ghost and HAMLET
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Where wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  Mark me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        I will.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.        My hour is almost come,<br>
      When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames<br>
      Must render up myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        Alas, poor ghost!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing<br>
      To what I shall unfold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        Speak; I am bound to hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  What?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  I am thy father’s spirit,<br>
      Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,<br>
      And for the day confin’d to fast in fires,<br>
      Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>
      Are burnt and purg’d away. But that I am forbid<br>
      To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br>
      I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
      Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
      Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
      Thy knotty and combined locks to part<br>
      And each particular hair to stand on end,<br>
      Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.<br>
      But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
      To ears of flesh and blood. List, Hamlet, O, list!<br>
      If thou didst ever thy dear father love—
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  O God!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Murder!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  Murder most foul, as in the best it is,<br>
      But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift<br>
      As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
      May sweep to my revenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.        I find thee apt;<br>
      And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
      That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br>
      Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.<br>
      It’s given out that, sleeping in mine orchard,<br>
      A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br>
      Is by a forged process of my death<br>
      Rankly abus’d; but know, thou noble youth,<br>
      The serpent that did sting thy father’s life<br>
      Now wears his crown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        O my prophetic soul!<br>
      Mine uncle!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
      With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—<br>
      O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
      So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust<br>
      The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.<br>
      O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br>
      From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
      That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
      I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
      Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
      To those of mine!<br>
      But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br>
      Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
      So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,<br>
      Will sate itself in a celestial bed<br>
      And prey on garbage.<br>
      But, soft! methinks I scent the morning’s air.<br>
      Brief let me be. Sleeping within mine orchard,<br>
      My custom always in the afternoon,<br>
      Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
      With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br>
      And in the porches of mine ears did pour<br>
      The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
      Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
      That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
      The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
      And with a sudden vigour it doth posset<br>
      And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
      The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,<br>
      And a most instant tetter bark’d about,<br>
      Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br>
      All my smooth body.<br>
      Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand<br>
      Of life, of crown, and queen, at once dispatch’d;<br>
      Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
      Unhousel’d, disappointed, unanel’d,<br>
      No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
      With all my imperfections on my head.<br>
      O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br>
      If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br>
      Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br>
      A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
      But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>
      Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
      Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven<br>
      And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br>
      To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br>
      The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br>
      And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.<br>
      Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.  Exit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?<br>
      And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart,<br>
      And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>
      But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br>
      Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br>
      In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br>
      Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
      I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
      All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>
      That youth and observation copied there,<br>
      And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>
      Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
      Unmix’d with baser matter. Yes, yes, by heaven!<br>
      O most pernicious woman!<br>
      O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br>
      My tables, my tables,—meet it is I set it down!<br>
      That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!<br>
      At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark.<br>
      So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;<br>
      It is “Adieu, adieu! remember me.”<br>
      I have sworn ’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar. & Hor.  (Within.)  My lord, my lord!
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.        [Within.]  Lord Hamlet!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        [Within.]  Heaven secure him!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  So be it!
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.  [Within.]  Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.  How is ’t, my noble lord?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        What news, my lord?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  O, wonderful!
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Good my lord, tell it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        No, you’ll reveal it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  Not I, my lord, by heaven.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.        Nor I, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  How say you, then, would heart of man once think it?—<br>
      But you’ll be secret?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor. & Mar.        Ay, by heaven, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark—<br>
      But he’s an arrant knave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave<br>
      To tell us this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        Why, right, you are i’ the right.<br>
      And so, without more circumstance at all,<br>
      I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;<br>
      You, as your business and desires shall point you,<br>
      For every man has business and desire,<br>
      Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,<br>
      Look you, I’ll go pray.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  I’m sorry they offend you, heartily;<br>
      Yes, faith, heartily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        There’s no offence, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br>
      And much offence too. Touching this vision here,<br>
      It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.<br>
      For your desire to know what is between us,<br>
      O’ermaster ’t as you may. And now, good friends,<br>
      As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,<br>
      Give me one poor request.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  What is ’t, my lord? We will.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor. & Mar.  My lord, we will not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.        Nay, but swear ’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        In faith,<br>
      My lord, not I.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.        Nor I, my lord, in faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Upon my sword.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mar.        We have sworn, my lord, already.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  Swear!  Ghost cries under the stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Ah, ha, boy! say’st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?<br>
      Come on; you hear this fellow in the cellarage.<br>
      Consent to swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.        Propose the oath, my lord.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Never to speak of this that you have seen.<br>
      Swear by my sword.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  [Beneath.]  Swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Hic et ubique? Then we’ll shift our ground.<br>
      Come thither, gentlemen,<br>
      And lay your hands again upon my sword.<br>
      Never to speak of this that you have heard,<br>
      Swear by my sword.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  [Beneath.]  Swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ the earth so fast?<br>
      A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hor.  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>
      There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
      Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.<br>
      But come;<br>
      Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br>
      How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,—<br>
      As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br>
      To put an antic disposition on—<br>
      That you, at such time seeing me, never shall,<br>
      With arms encumb’red thus, or this headshake,<br>
      Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br>
      As “Well, we know,” or “We could, an if we would,”<br>
      Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be, an if they might,”<br>
      Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br>
      That you know aught of me,—this not to do,<br>
      So grace and mercy at your most need help you,<br>
      Swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ghost.  [Beneath.]  Swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ham.  Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! [They swear.] So, gentlemen,<br>
      With all my love I do commend me to you.<br>
      And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br>
      May do, to express his love and friending to you,<br>
      God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;<br>
      And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br>
      The time is out of joint;—O cursed spite,<br>
      That ever I was born to set it right!<br>
      Nay, come, let’s go together.  Exeunt.
