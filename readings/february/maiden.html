      <h2>HERMANN AND DOROTHEA</h2>

      <h2>CALLIOPE</h2>

      <h2>FATE AND SYMPATHY</h2>

      <p>
        TRULY, I never have seen the market and street so deserted! How as if it were swept looks the town, or had perished!
      </p>

      <p>
        Not fifty <br>
        Are there, methinks, of all our inhabitants in it remaining. <br>
        What will not curiosity do! here is every one running, <br>
        Hurrying to gaze on the sad procession of pitiful exiles. <br>
        Fully a league it must be to the causeway they have to pass over, <br>
        Yet all are hurrying down in the dusty heat of the noonday. <br>
        I, in good sooth, would not stir from my place to witness the sorrows <br>
        Borne by good, fugitive people, who now, with their rescued possessions, <br>
        Driven, alas! from beyond the Rhine, their beautiful country, <br>
        Over to us are coming, and through the prosperous corner <br>
        Roam of this our luxuriant valley, and traverse its windings. <br>
        Well hast thou done, good wife, our son in thus kindly dispatching, <br>
        Laden with something to eat and to drink, and with store of old linen, <br>
        'Mongst the poor folk to distribute; for giving belongs to the wealthy. <br>
        How the youth drives, to be sure! What control he has over the horses! <br>
        Makes not our carriage a handsome appearance,—the new one? <br>
        With comfort, <br>
        Four could be seated within, with a place on the box for the coachman. <br>
        This time, he drove by himself. How lightly it rolled round the corner!" <br>
        Thus, as he sat at his ease in the porch of his house on the market, <br>
        Unto his wife was speaking mine host of the Golden Lion.
      </p>

      <p>
        [...]
      </p>

      <h2>MELPOMENE</h2>

      <h2>HERMANN AND DOROTHEA</h2>

      <p>
        TOWARDS the setting sun the two thus went on their journey: <br>
        Close he had wrapped himself round with clouds portending a tempest. <br>
        Out from the veil, now here and now there, with fiery flashes, <br>
        Gleaming over the field shot forth the ominous lightning. <br>
        "May not these threatening heavens," said Hermann, "be presently sending <br>
        Hailstones upon us and violent rains; for fair is the harvest." <br>
        And in the waving luxuriant grain they delighted together: <br>
        Almost as high it reached as the lofty shapes that moved through it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon spoke the maiden, and said to her guide and companion: <br>
        "Friend, unto whom I soon am to owe so kindly a fortune, <br>
        Shelter and home, while many an exile's exposed to the tempest, <br>
        Tell me concerning thy parents, I pray thee, and teach me to know them, <br>
        Them whom with all my heart I desire to serve in the future. <br>
        Who understands his master, more easily gives satisfaction, <br>
        Having regard to the things which to him seem chief in importance, <br>
        And on the doing of which his firm-set mind is determined. <br>
        Tell me therefore, I pray, how to win thy father and mother."
      </p>

      <p>
        And to her question made answer the good and intelligent Hermann: <br>
        "Ah, what wisdom thou showest, thou good, thou excellent maiden, <br>
        Asking thus first of all concerning the tastes of my parents! <br>
        Know that in vain hitherto I have labored in serving my father, <br>
        Taking upon me as were it my own, the charge of the household; <br>
        Early and late at work in the fields, and o'erseeing the vineyard. <br>
        But my mother I fully content, who can value my service; <br>
        And thou wilt also appear in her eyes the worthiest of maidens, <br>
        If for the house thou carest, as were it thine own thou wast keeping. <br>
        Otherwise is it with father, who cares for the outward appearance. <br>
        Do not regard me, good maiden, as one who is cold and unfeeling, <br>
        That unto thee a stranger I straightway discover my father.<br>
        Nay, I assure thee that never before have words such as these are <br>
        Freely dropped from my tongue, which is not accustomed to prattle; <br>
        But from out of my bosom thou lurest its every secret.<br>
        Some of the graces of life my good father covets about him, <br>
        Outward signs of affection he wishes, as well as of honor; <br>
        And an inferior servant might possibly give satisfaction, <br>
        Who could turn these to account, while he might be displeased with <br>
        a better."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon said she with joy, the while her hastening footsteps <br>
        Over the darkening pathway with easy motion she quickened: <br>
        "Truly I hope to them both I shall equally give satisfaction: <br>
        For in thy mother's nature I find such an one as mine own is, <br>
        And to the outward graces I've been from my childhood accustomed. <br>
        Greatly was courtesy valued among our neighbors the Frenchmen, <br>
        During their earlier days; it was common to noble and burgher, <br>
        As to the peasant, and every one made it the rule of his household. <br>
        So, on the side of us Germans, the children were likewise accustomed <br>
        Daily to bring to their parents, with kissing of hands and with curtseys, <br>
        Morning good-wishes, and all through the day to be prettily mannered. <br>
        Every thing thus that I learned, and to which I've been used from my childhood, <br>
        All that my heart shall suggest, shall be brought into play for thy father. <br>
        But who shall tell me of thee, and how thyself shouldst be treated, <br>
        Thou the only son of the house, and henceforth my master?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus she said, and e'en as she spoke they stood under the pear-tree. <br>
        Down from the heavens the moon at her full was shedding her splendor. <br>
        Night had come on, and wholly obscured was the last gleam of
        sunlight, <br>
        So that contrasting masses lay side by side with each other, <br>
        Clear and bright as the day, and black with the shadows of midnight; <br>
        Gratefully fell upon Hermann's ear the kindly asked question <br>
        Under the shade of the glorious tree, the spot he so treasured, <br>
        Which but this morning had witnessed the tears he had shed for
        the exile. <br>
        And while they sat themselves down to rest them here for a little, <br>
        Thus spoke the amorous youth, as he grasped the hand of the
        maiden <br>
        "Suffer thy heart to make answer, and follow it freely in all things." <br>
        Yet naught further he ventured to say although so propitious <br>
        Seemed the hour: he feared he should only haste on a refusal. <br>
        Ah, and he felt besides the ring on her finger, sad token! <br>
        Therefore they sat there, silent and still, beside one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        First was the maiden to speak: "How sweet is this glorious moon-light!" <br>
        Said she at length: "It is as the light of the day in its brightness. <br>
        There in the city I plainly can see the houses and courtyards, <br>
        And in the gable—methinks I can number its panes—is a window."
      </p>

      <p>
        "What thou seest," the modest youth thereupon made her answer,--- <br>
        "What thou seest is our dwelling, to which I am leading thee downward, <br>
        And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic, <br>
        Which will be thine prerhaps, for various changes are making. <br>
        All these fields, too, are ours; they are ripe for the harvest to-morrow. <br>
        Here in the shade we will rest, and partake of our noontide refreshment. <br>
        But it is time we began our descent through the vineyard and garden; <br>
        For dost thou mark how yon threatening storm loud comes nearer and nearer, <br>
        Charged with lightning, and ready our fair full moon to extinguish?"
      </p>

      <p>
        So they arose from their seats, and over the cornfields descended, <br>
        Through the luxuriant grain, enjoying the brightness of evening, <br>
        Until they came to the vineyard, and so entered into its shadow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he guided her down o'er the numerous blocks that were lying, <br>
        Rough and unhewn on the pathway, and served as the steps of the alley. <br>
        Slowly the maiden descended, and leaning her hands on his shoulder, <br>
        While with uncertain beams, the moon through the leaves over-
        looked them, <br>
        Ere she was veiled by the cloud, and so left the couple in darkness. <br>
        Carefully Hermann's strength supported the maid that hung o'er
        him; <br>
        But, not knowing the path and the rough-hewn steps that led
        down it, <br>
        Missed she her footing, her ankle turned, and she surely had fallen, <br>
        Had not the dexterous youth his arm outstretched in an instant, <br>
        And his beloved upheld. She gently sank on his shoulder; <br>
        Breast was pressed against breast, and cheek against cheek. Thus
        he stood there <br>
        Fixed as a marble statue, the force of will keeping him steadfast, <br>
        Drew her not to him more closely, but braced himself under her
        pressure. <br>
        Thus he the glorious burden felt, the warmth of her bosom, <br>
        And the perfume of her breath, that over his lips was exhaling; <br>
        Bore with the heart of a man the majestic form of the woman.
      </p>

      <p>
        But she with playfulness said, concealing the pain that she suffered: <br>
        "That is a sign of misfortune, so timorous persons would tell us, <br>
        When on approaching a house we stumble not far from the threshold; <br>
        And for myself, I confess, I could wish for a happier omen. <br>
        Let us here linger awhile that thy parents may not have to blame
        thee, <br>
        Seeing a limping maid, and thou seem an incompetent landlord."
      </p>

      <h2>URANIA</h2>

      <h2>PROSPECT</h2>

      <p>
        MUSES, O ye who the course of true love so willingly favor, <br>
        Ye who thus far on his way the excellent youth have
        conducted, <br>
        Even before the betrothal have pressed to his bosom the maiden; <br>
        Further your aid vouchsafe this charming pair in uniting, <br>
        Straightway dispersing the clouds which over their happiness lower! <br>
        Yet first of all declare what is passing meanwhile at the Lion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now for the third time again the mother impatient had entered <br>
        Where were assembled the men, whom anxious but now she had
        quitted; <br>
        Spoke of the gathering storm, and the moonlight's rapid obscuring; <br>
        Then of her son's late tarrying abroad and the dangers of nightfall; <br>
        Sharply upbraided her friends that without having speech of the
        maiden, <br>
        And without urging his suit, they had parted from Hermann so
        early.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Make it not worse than it is," the father replied with displeasure. "For, as thou seest, we tarry ourselves and are waiting the issue."
      </p>

      <p>
        Calmly, however, from where he was sitting the neighbor made answer: <br>
        "Never in hours of disquiet like this do I fail to be grateful <br>
        Unto my late, blessed father, who every root of impatience <br>
        Tore from my heart when a child, and left no fibre remaining; <br>
        So that I learned on the instant to wait as do none of your sages."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Tell us," the pastor returned, "what legerdemain he made use of." <br>
        "That will I gladly relate, for all may draw from it a lesson;" <br>
        So made the neighbor reply. "When a boy I once stood of a Sunday <br>
        Full of impatience, and looking with eagerness out for the carriage <br>
        Which was to carry us forth to the spring that lies under the lindens. <br>
        Still the coach came not. I ran, like a weasel, now hither, now
        thither, <br>
        Up stairs and down, and forward and back, 'twixt the door and the
        window; <br>
        Even my fingers itched to be moving; I scratched on the tables, <br>
        Went about pounding and stamping, and hardly could keep me from
        weeping. <br>
        All was observed by the calm-tempered man; but at last when my
        folly <br>
        Came to be carried too far, by the arm he quietly took me, <br>
        Led me away to the window, and spoke in this serious language: <br>
        'Seest thou yonder the carpenter's shop that is closed for the Sunday? <br>
        He will re-open to-morrow, when plane and saw will be started, <br>
        And will keep on through the hours of labor from morning till
        evening. <br>
        But consider you this,—a day will be presently coming <br>
        When that man shall himself be astir and all of his workmen, <br>
        Making a coffin for thee to be quickly and skilfully finished. <br>
        Then that house of boards they will busily bring over hither, <br>
        Which must at last receive alike the impatient and patient, <br>
        And which is destined soon with close-pressing roof to be covered.' <br>
        Straightway I saw the whole thing in my mind as if it were doing; <br>
        Saw the boards fitting together, and saw the black color preparing, <br>
        Sat me down patiently then, and in quiet awaited the carriage. <br>
        Now when others I see, in seasons of anxious expectance, <br>
        Running distracted about, I cannot but think of the coffin."
      </p>

      <p>
        Smiling, the pastor replied: "The affecting picture of death stands <br>
        Not as a dread to the wise, and not as an end to the pious. <br>
        Those it presses again into life, and teaches to use it; <br>
        These by affliction it strengthens in hope to future salvation. <br>
        Death becomes life unto both. Thy father was greatly mistaken <br>
        When to a sensitive boy he death in death thus depicted. <br>
        Let us the value of nobly ripe age, point out to the young man, <br>
        And to the aged the youth, that in the eternal progression <br>
        Both may rejoice, and life may in life thus find its completion."
      </p>

      <p>
        But the door was now opened, and showed the majestical couple. <br>
        Filled with amaze were the friends, and amazed the affectionate
        parents, <br>
        Seeing the form of the maid so well matched with that of her lover. <br>
        Yea, the door seemed too low to allow the tall figures to enter,<br>
        As they together now appeared coming over the threshold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hermann, with hurried words, presented her thus to his parents: <br>
        "Here is a maiden," he said; "such a one as ye wish in the household. <br>
        Kindly receive her, dear father: she merits it well; and thou, mother, <br>
        Question her straightway on all that belongs to a housekeeper's duty, <br>
        That ye may see how well she deserves to ye both to be nearer."
      </p>

      <p>
        Quickly he then drew aside the excellent clergyman, saying: <br>
        "Help me, O worthy sir, and speedily out of this trouble; <br>
        Loosen, I pray thee, this knot, at whose untying I tremble. <br>
        Know that 'tis not as a lover that 1 have brought hither the maiden; <br>
        But she believes that as servant she comes to the house, and I tremble <br>
        Lest in displeasure she fly as soon as there's mention of marriage. <br>
        But be it straightway decided; for she no longer in error <br>
        Thus shall be left, and I this suspense no longer can suffer. <br>
        Hasten and show us in this a proof of the wisdom we honor."
      </p>

      <p>
        Towards the company then the clergyman instantly turned him; <br>
        But already, alas! had the soul of the maiden been troubled, <br>
        Hearing the father's speech; for he, in his sociable fashion, <br>
        Had in these playful words, with the kindest intention addressed
        her: <br>
        "Ay, this is well, my child! with delight I perceive that my Hermann <br>
        Has the good taste of his father, who often showed his in his young
        days, <br>
        Leading out always the fairest to dance, and brincing the fairest <br>
        Finally home as his wife; our dear little mother here that was. <br>
        For by the bride that a man shall elect we can judge what himself is, <br>
        Tell what the spirit is in him, and whether he feel his own value. <br>
        Nor didst thou need for thyself, I'll engage, much time for decision; <br>
        For, in good sooth, methinks, he's no difficult person to follow."
      </p>

      <p>
        Hermann had heard but in part; his limbs were inwardly trembling, <br>
        And of a sudden a stillness had fallen on all of the circle.
      </p>

      <p>
        But by these words of derision, for such she could not but deem them, <br>
        Wounded, and stung to the depths of her soul, the excellent maiden, <br>
        Stood, while the fugitive blood o'er her cheeks and e'en to her bosom <br>
        Poured its flush. But she governed herself, and her courage collecting, <br>
        Answered the old man thus, her pain not wholly conceaUng: <br>
        "Truly for such a reception thy son had in no wise prepared me, <br>
        When he the ways of his father described, the excellent burgher. <br>
        Thou art a man of culture, I know, before whom I am standing; <br>
        Dealest with every one wisely, according as suits his position; <br>
        But thou hast scanty compassion, it seems, on one such as I am, <br>
        Who, a poor girl, am now crossing thy threshold with purpose to
        serve thee; <br>
        Else, with such bitter derision, thou wouldst not have made me remember <br>
        How far removed my fortune from that of thyself and thy son is. <br>
        True, I come poor to thy house, and bring with me naught but my
        bundle <br>
        Here where is every abundance to gladden the prosperous inmates. <br>
        Yet I know well myself; I feel the relations between us. <br>
        Say, is it noble, with so much of mockery straightway to greet me, <br>
        That I am sent from the house while my foot is scarce yet on the
        threshold?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Anxiously Hermann turned and signed to his ally the pastor <br>
        That he should rush to the rescue and straightway dispel the delusion. <br>
        Then stepped the wise man hastily forward and looked on the
        maiden's <br>
        Tearful eyes, her silent pain and repressed indignation, <br>
        And in his heart was impelled not at once to clear up the confusion, <br>
        Rather to put to the test the girl's disquieted spirit.<br>
        Therefore he unto her said in language intended to try her: <br>
        "Surely, thou foreign-born maiden, thou didst not maturely consider, <br>
        When thou too rashly decidedst to enter the service of strangers, <br>
        All that is meant by the placing thyself 'neath the rule of a master; <br>
        For by our hand to a bargain the fate of the year is determined, <br>
        And but a single 'yea' compels to much patient endurance. <br>
        Not the worst part of the service the wearisome steps to be taken, <br>
        Neither the bitter sweat of a labor that presses unceasing; <br>
        Since the industrious freeman must toil as well as the servant. <br>
        But 'tis to bear with the master's caprice when he censures unjustly, <br>
        Or when, at variance with self, he orders now this, now the other; <br>
        Bear with the petulance, too, of the mistress, easily angered, <br>
        And with the rude, overbearing ways of unmannerly children. <br>
        All this is hard to endure, and yet to go on with thy duties <br>
        Quickly, without delay, nor thyself grow sullen and stubborn. <br>
        Yet thou appearest ill-fitted for this, since already so deeply <br>
        Stung by the father's jests: whereas there is nothing more common <br>
        Than for a girl to be teased on account of a youth she may fancy."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus he spoke. The.maiden had felt the full force of his language, <br>
        And she restrained her no more; but with passionate outburst her
        feelings <br>
        Made themselves way; a sob broke forth from her now heaving
        bosom, <br>
        And, while the scalding tears poured down, she straightway made
        answer: <br>
        "Ah, that rational man who thinks to advise us in sorrow, <br>
        Knows not how little of power his cold words have in relieving <br>
        Ever a heart from that woe which a sovereign fate has inflicted. <br>
        Ye are prosperous and glad; how then should a pleasantry wound
        you? <br>
        Yet but the lightest touch is a source of pain to the sick man. <br>
        Nay, concealment itself, if successful, had profited nothing. <br>
        Better show now what had later increased to a bitterer anguish, <br>
        And to an inward consuming despair naight perhaps have reduced
        me. <br>
        Let me go back! for here in this house I can tarry no longer. <br>
        I will away, and wander in search of my hapless companions, <br>
        Whom I forsook in their need; for myself alone choosing the better. <br>
        This is my firm resolve, and I therefore may make a confession <br>
        Which might for years perhaps have else lain hid in my bosom. <br>
        Deeply indeed was I hurt by the father's words of derision; <br>
        Not that I'm sensitive, proud beyond what is fitting a servant; <br>
        But that my heart in truth had felt itself stirred with affection <br>
        Towards the youth who to-day had appeared to my eyes as a savior. <br>
        When he first left me there on the road, he still remained present, <br>
        Haunting my every thought; I fancied the fortunate maiden <br>
        Whom as a bride, perhaps, his heart had already elected. <br>
        When at the fountain I met him again, the sight of him wakened <br>
        Pleasure as great as if there had met me an angel from heaven; <br>
        And with what gladness I followed, when asked to come as his
        servant. <br>
        True, that I flattered myself in my heart,—I will not deny it,- <br>
        While we were hitherward coming, I might peradventure deserve
        him, <br>
        Should I become at last the important stay of the household. <br>
        Now I, alas! for the first time see what risk I was running, <br>
        When I would make my home so near to the secretly loved one; <br>
        Now for the first time feel how far removed a poor maiden <br>
        Is from an opulent youth, no matter how great her deserving. <br>
        All this I now confess, that my heart ye may not misinterpret, <br>
        In that 'twas hurt by a chance to which I owe my awaking. <br>
        Hiding my secret desires, this dread had been ever before me, <br>
        That at some early day he would bring him a bride to his dwelling; <br>
        And ah, how could I then my inward anguish have suffered!<br>
        Happily I have been warned, and happily now has my bosom <br>
        Been of its secret relieved, while yet there is cure for the evil. <br>
        But no more; I have spoken; and now shall nothing detain me <br>
        Longer here in a house where I stay but in shame and confusion, <br>
        Freely confessing my love and that foolish hope that I cherished. <br>
        Not the night which abroad is covered with lowering storm clouds; <br>
        Not the roll of the thunder—I hear its peal—shall deter me; <br>
        Not the pelt of the rain which without is beating in fury; <br>
        Neither the blustering tempest; for all these things have I suffered <br>
        During our sorrowful flight, and while the near foe was pursuing. <br>
        Now I again go forth, as I have so long been accustomed, <br>
        Carried away by the whirl of the times, and from every thing parted. <br>
        Fare ye well! I tarry no longer; all now is over."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus she spoke and back to the door she hastily turned her, <br>
        Still bearing under her arm, as she with her had brought it, her
        bundle. <br>
        But with both of her arms the mother seized hold of the maiden, <br>
        Clasping her round the waist, and exclaiming, amazed and bewildered: <br>
        "Tell me, what means all this? and these idle tears, say, what mean
        they? <br>
        I will not let thee depart: thou art the betrothed of my Hermann."
      </p>

      <p>
        But still the father stood, observing the scene with displeasure, <br>
        Looked on the weeping girl, and said in a tone of vexation: <br>
        "This then must be the return that I get for all my indulgence, <br>
        That at the close of the day this most irksome of all things should
        happen! <br>
        For there is naught I can tolerate less than womanish weeping, <br>
        Violent outcries, which only involve in disorder and passion, <br>
        What with a little of sense had been more smoothly adjusted. <br>
        Settle the thing for yourselves: I'm going to bed; I've no patience <br>
        Longer to be a spectator of these your marvellous doings." <br>
        Quickly he turned as he spoke, and hastened to go to the chamber <br>
        Where he was wonted to rest, and his marriage bed was kept standing, <br>
        But he was held by his son, who said in a tone of entreaty: <br>
        "Father, hasten not from us, and be thou not wroth with the
        maiden. <br>
        I, only I, am to blame as the cause of all this confusion, <br>
        Which by his dissimulation our friend unexpectedly heightened. <br>
        Speak, O worthy sir; for to thee my cause I intrusted. <br>
        Heap not up sorrow and anger, but rather let all this be ended; <br>
        For I could hold thee never again in such high estimation, <br>
        If thou shouldst show but delight in pain, not superior wisdom."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon answered and said the excellent clergyman, smiling: <br>
        "Tell me, what other device could have drawn this charming confession <br>
        Out of the good maiden's lips, and thus have revealed her affection? <br>
        Has not thy trouble been straightway transformed into gladness and
        rapture? <br>
        Therefore speak up for thyself; what need of the tongue of another?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon Hermann came forward, and spoke in these words of affection <br>
        "Do not repent of thy tears, nor repent of these passing distresses; <br>
        For they complete my joy, and—may I not hope it—thine also? <br>
        Not to engage the stranger, the excellent maid, as a servant, <br>
        Unto the fountain I came; but to sue for thy love I came thither. <br>
        Only, alas! my timorous look could thy heart's inclination <br>
        Nowise perceive; I read in thine eyes of nothing but kindness, <br>
        As from the fountain's tranquil mirror thou gavest me greeting.<br>
        Might I but bring thee home, the half of my joy was accomplished. <br>
        But thou completest it unto me now; oh, blest be thou for it!" <br>
        Then with a deep emotion the maiden gazed on the stripling; <br>
        Neither forbade she embrace and kiss, the summit of rapture, <br>
        When to a loving pair they come as the longed-for assurance, <br>
        Pledge of a lifetime of bliss, that appears to them now never-ending.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unto the others, meanwhile, the pastor had made explanation. <br>
        But with feeling and grace the maid now advanced to the father, <br>
        Bent her before him, and kissing the hand he would fain have withholden, <br>
        Said: "Thou wilt surely be just and forgive one so startled as I was, <br>
        First for my tears of distress, and now for the tears of my gladness. <br>
        That emotion forgive me, and oh! forgive me this also. <br>
        For I can scarce comprehend the happiness newly vouchsafed me. <br>
        Yes, let that first vexation of which I, bewildered, was guilty <br>
        Be too the last. Whatever the maid of affectionate service <br>
        Faithfully promised, shall be to thee now performed by the daughter."
      </p>

      <p>
        Straightway then, concealing his tears, the father embraced her, <br>
        Cordially, too, the mother came forward and kissed her with fervor, <br>
        Pressing her hands in her own: the weeping women were silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thereupon quickly he seized, the good and intelligent pastor, <br>
        First the father's hand, and the wedding-ring drew from his finger,-<br>
        Not so easily either: the finger was plump and detained it,-<br>
        Next took the mother's ring also, and with them betrothed he the
        children, <br>
        Saying: "These golden circlets once more their office performing <br>
        Firmly a tie shall unite, which in all things shall equal the old one, <br>
        Deeply is this young man imbued with love of the maiden, <br>
        And, as the maiden confesses, her heart is gone out to him also. <br>
        Here do I therefore betroth you and bless for the years that are
        coming, <br>
        With the consent of the parents, and having this friend as a witness."
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the neighbor saluted at once, and expressed his good wishes;<br>
        But when the clergyman now the golden circlet was drawing <br>
        Over the maiden's hand, he observed with amazement the other, <br>
        Which had already by Hermann been anxiously marked at the
        fountain.<br>
        And with a kindly raillery thus thereupon he addressed her:<br>
        "So, then thy second betrothal is this? let us hope the first bridegroom <br>
        May not appear at the altar, and so prohibit the marriage."
      </p>

      <p>
        But she, answering, said : "Oh, let me to this recollection <br>
        Yet one moment devote; for so much is due the good giver, <br>
        Him who bestowed it at parting, and never came back to his kindred. <br>
        All that should come he foresaw, when in haste the passion for
        freedom, <br>
        When a desire in the newly changed order of things to be working, <br>
        Urged him onward to Paris, where chains and death he encountered. <br>
        'Fare thee well,' were his words; 'I go, for all is in motion <br>
        Now for a time on the earth, and every thing seems to be parting. <br>
        E'en in the firmest states fundamental laws are dissolving; <br>
        Property falls away from the hand of the ancient possessor; <br>
        Friend is parted from friend; and so parts lover from lover. <br>
        Here I leave thee, and where I shall find thee again, or if ever, <br>
        Who can tell? Perhaps these words are our last ones together. <br>
        Man's but a stranger here on the earth, we are told and with
        reason; <br>
        And we are each of us now become more of strangers than ever. <br>
        Ours no more is the soil, and our treasures are all of them changing: <br>
        Silver and gold are melting away from their time-honored patterns. <br>
        All is in motion as though the already-shaped world into chaos <br>
        Meant to resolve itself backward into night, and to shape itself over. <br>
        Mine thou wilt keep thine heart, and should we be ever united <br>
        Over the ruins of earth, it will be as newly made creatures,<br>
        Beings transformed and free, no longer dependent on fortune; <br>
        For can aught fetter the man who has lived through days such as
        these are!<br>
        But if it is not to be, that, these dangers happily over, <br>
        Ever again we be granted the bliss of mutual embraces, <br>
        Oh, then before thy thoughts so keep my hovering image <br>
        That with unshaken mind thou be ready for good or for evil! <br>
        Should new ties allure thee again, and a new habitation, <br>
        Enter with gratitude into the joys that fate shall prepare thee; <br>
        Love those purely who love thee; be grateful to them who show
        kindness. <br>
        But thine uncertain foot should yet be planted but lightly, <br>
        For there is lurking the twofold pain of a new separation. <br>
        Blessings attend thy life; but value existence no higher <br>
        Than thine other possessions, and all possessions are cheating!' <br>
        Thus spoke the noble youth, and never again I beheld him. <br>
        Meanwhile I lost my all, and a thousand times thought of his
        warning. <br>
        Here, too, I think of his words, when love is sweetly preparing <br>
        Happiness for me anew, and glorious hopes are reviving. <br>
        Oh forgive me, excellent friend, that e'en while I hold thee <br>
        Close to my side I tremble! So unto the late-landed sailor <br>
        Seem the most solid foundations of firmest earth to be rocking."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus she spoke, and placed the two rings on her finger together. <br>
        But her lover replied with a noble and manly emotion:<br>
        "So much the firmer then, amid these universal convulsions, <br>
        Be, Dorothea, our union! We two will hold fast and continue, <br>
        Firmly maintaining ourselves, and the right to our ample possessions. <br>
        For that man, who, when times are uncertain, is faltering in spirit, <br>
        Only increases the evil, and further and further transmits it; <br>
        While he refashions the world, who keeps himself steadfastly
        minded. <br>
        Poorly becomes it the German to give to these fearful excitements <br>
        Aught of continuance, or to be this way and that way inclining. <br>
        This is our own! let that be our word, and let us maintain it! <br>
        For to those resolute peoples respect will be ever accorded, <br>
        Who for God and the laws, for parents, women and children, <br>
        Fought and died, as together they stood with their front to the
        foeman. <br>
        Thou art mine own; and now what is mine, is mine more than
        ever. <br>
        Not with anxiety will I preserve it, and trembling enjoyment; <br>
        Rather with courage and strength. To-day should the enemy
        threaten, <br>
        Or in the future, equip me thyself and hand me my weapons. <br>
        Let me but know that under thy care are my house and dear parents, <br>
        Oh! I can then with assurance expose my breast to the foeman. <br>
        And were but every man minded like me, there would be an upspring <br>
        Might against might, and peace should revisit us all with its gladness."
