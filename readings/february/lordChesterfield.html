          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_Chesterfield" target="_blank">The Letter to Chesterfield</a>
           (February 1755) was Samuel Johnson's response to what some believed to
           be Lord Chesterfield's opportunistic endorsement of his
           <em>A Dictionary of the English Language</em>. Although Chesterfield was
           patron of the Proposal for the Dictionary, he made no moves to further
           the progress of the Dictionary until seven years after his original
           investment into the project. Suddenly, Chesterfield wrote two "puff"
           pieces to promote the Dictionary, which prompted Johnson to write a
           letter accusing Chesterfield of only providing help when it was least needed.
           Some claim that the letter caused a minor furore in the contemporary
           literary world when Johnson made it public and it has been the subject
           of critical comment ever since; it has been described as literature's
           "declaration of independence". However, Chesterfield's reaction
           to the letter was quite different, and he praised Johnson's
           intellect and ability to write after reading it for the first time.
           Johnson could not believe that Chesterfield would ever react favourably
           towards the letter, and it was not until years later that
           Chesterfield and Johnson would finally reconcile.

      <h2>Letter to the Right Honorable the Earl of Chesterfield</h2>

      <p>
        February 7, 1755.
      </p>

      <p>
        MY LORD:
      </p>

      <p>
        I HAVE lately been informed by the proprietor of The World, that two papers, in which my Dictionary is recommended to the public, were written by your Lordship. To be so distinguished is an honor which, being very little accustomed to favours from the great, I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to acknowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        When, upon some slight encouragement, I first visited your Lordship, I was overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by the enchantment of your address; and I could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself ‘<span class="tooltip">Le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre<span class="tooltiptext">"The conqueror of the world's conqueror"</span></span>’; that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending; but I found my attendance so little encouraged, that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it. When I had once addressed your Lordship in public, I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can possess. I had done all that I could; and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seven years, my Lord, have now passed, since I waited in your outward rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties, of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it at last to the verge of publication, without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile of favor. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a Patron before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love, and found him a native of the rocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labors, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I hope it is no very cynical <span class="tooltip">asperity<span class="tooltiptext">harshness of tone or manner.</span></span> not to confess obligations where no benefit has been received, or to be unwilling that the Public should consider me as owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me to do for myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favorer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it, if less be possible, with less; for I have been long wakened from that dream of hope, in which I once boasted myself with so much exultation,
      </p>

      <p>
        My Lord, Your Lordship’s most humble,
      </p>

      <p>
        Most obedient servant,                SAM. JOHNSON.
