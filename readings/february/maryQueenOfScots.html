      <h2>Lament of Mary, Queen of Scots</h2>

      <p>
        NOW Nature hangs her mantle green <br>
          On every blooming tree,<br>
        And spreads her sheets o’ daisies white<br>
          Out o’er the grassy lea;<br>
        Now Phoebus cheers the crystal streams,<br>
          And glads the azure skies;<br>
        But nought can glad the weary wight<br>
          That fast in durance lies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now laverocks wake the merry morn<br>
          Aloft on dewy wing;<br>
        The merle, in his noontide bow’r,<br>
          Makes woodland echoes ring;<br>
        The mavis wild wi’ mony a note,<br>
          Sings drowsy day to rest:<br>
        In love and freedom they rejoice,<br>
          Wi’ care nor thrall opprest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now blooms the lily by the bank,<br>
          The primrose down the brae;<br>
        The hawthorn’s budding in the glen,<br>
          And milk-white is the slae:<br>
        The meanest hind in fair Scotland<br>
          May rove their sweets amang;<br>
        But I, the Queen of a’ Scotland,<br>
          Maun lie in prison strang.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was the Queen o’ bonie France,<br>
          Where happy I hae been;<br>
        Fu’ lightly raise I in the morn,<br>
          As blythe lay down at e’en:<br>
        And I’m the sov’reign of Scotland,<br>
          And mony a traitor there;<br>
        Yet here I lie in foreign bands,<br>
          And never-ending care.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as for thee, thou false woman,<br>
          My sister and my fae,<br>
        Grim Vengeance yet shall whet a sword<br>
          That thro’ thy soul shall gae;<br>
        The weeping blood in woman’s breast<br>
          Was never known to thee;<br>
        Nor th’ balm that draps on wounds of woe<br>
          Frae woman’s pitying e’e.
      </p>

      <p>
        My son! my son! may kinder stars<br>
          Upon thy fortune shine;<br>
        And may those pleasures gild thy reign,<br>
          That ne’er wad blink on mine!<br>
        God keep thee frae thy mother’s faes,<br>
          Or turn their hearts to thee:<br>
        And where thou meet’st thy mother’s friend,<br>
          Remember him for me!
      </p>

      <p>
        O! soon, to me, may Summer suns<br>
          Nae mair light up the morn!<br>
        Nae mair to me the Autumn winds<br>
          Wave o’er the yellow corn?<br>
        And, in the narrow house of death,<br>
          Let Winter round me rave;<br>
        And the next flow’rs that deck the Spring,<br>
          Bloom on my peaceful grave!
      </p>

      <h2>Song—There’ll never be Peace till Jamie comes hame</h2>

      <p>
        BY yon Castle wa’, at the close of the day,<br>
        I heard a man sing, tho’ his head it was grey:<br>
        And as he was singing, the tears doon came,—<br>
        There’ll never be peace till Jamie comes hame.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Church is in ruins, the State is in jars,<br>
        Delusions, oppressions, and murderous wars,<br>
        We dare na weel say’t, but we ken wha’s to blame,—<br>
        There’ll never be peace till Jamie comes hame.
      </p>

      <p>
        My seven braw sons for Jamie drew sword,<br>
        But now I greet round their green beds in the yerd;<br>
        It brak the sweet heart o’ my faithful and dame,—<br>
        There’ll never be peace till Jamie comes hame.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now life is a burden that bows me down,<br>
        Sin’ I tint my bairns, and he tint his crown;<br>
        But till my last moments my words are the same,—<br>
        There’ll never be peace till Jamie comes hame.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—Out over the Forth</h2>

      <p>
        OUT over the Forth, I look to the North;<br>
          But what is the north and its Highlands to me?<br>
        The south nor the east gie ease to my breast,<br>
          The far foreign land, or the wide rolling sea.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I look to the west when I gae to rest,<br>
          That happy my dreams and my slumbers may be;<br>
        For far in the west lives he I loe best,<br>
          The man that is dear to my babie and me.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—The Banks o’ Doon (First Version)</h2>

      <p>
        SWEET are the banks—the banks o’ Doon,<br>
          The spreading flowers are fair,<br>
        And everything is blythe and glad,<br>
          But I am fu’ o’ care.<br>
        Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonie bird,<br>
          That sings upon the bough;<br>
        Thou minds me o’ the happy days<br>
          When my fause Luve was true:<br>
        Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonie bird,<br>
          That sings beside thy mate;<br>
        For sae I sat, and sae I sang,<br>
          And wist na o’ my fate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aft hae I rov’d by bonie Doon,<br>
          To see the woodbine twine;<br>
        And ilka birds sang o’ its Luve,<br>
          And sae did I o’ mine:<br>
        Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,<br>
          Upon its thorny tree;<br>
        But my fause Luver staw my rose<br>
          And left the thorn wi’ me:<br>
        Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,<br>
          Upon a morn in June;<br>
        And sae I flourished on the morn,<br>
          And sae was pu’d or noon!
      </p>

      <h2>Song—The Banks o’ Doon (Second Version)</h2>

      <p>
        YE flowery banks o’ bonie Doon,<br>
          How can ye blume sae fair?<br>
        How can ye chant, ye little birds,<br>
          And I sae fu’ o care!<br>
        Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonie bird,<br>
          That sings upon the bough!<br>
        Thou minds me o’ the happy days<br>
          When my fause Luve was true.<br>
        Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonie bird,<br>
          That sings beside thy mate;<br>
        For sae I sat, and sae I sang,<br>
          And wist na o’ my fate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aft hae I rov’d by bonie Doon,<br>
          To see the woodbine twine;<br>
        And ilka bird sang o’ its Luve,<br>
          And sae did I o’ mine.<br>
        Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,<br>
          Upon its thorny tree;<br>
        But my fause Luver staw my rose,<br>
          And left the thorn wi’ me.<br>
        Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,<br>
          Upon a morn in June;<br>
        And sae I flourished on the morn,<br>
          And sae was pu’d or noon.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—The Banks o’ Doon (Third Version)</h2>

      <p>
        YE banks and braes o’ bonie Doon,<br>
          How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair?<br>
        How can ye chant, ye little birds,<br>
          And I sae weary fu’ o’ care!<br>
        Thou’ll break my heart, thou warbling bird,<br>
          That wantons thro’ the flowering thorn:<br>
        Thou minds me o’ departed joys,<br>
          Departed never to return.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aft hae I rov’d by Bonie Doon,<br>
          To see the rose and woodbine twine:<br>
        And ilka bird sang o’ its Luve,<br>
          And fondly sae did I o’ mine;<br>
        Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose,<br>
          Fu’ sweet upon its thorny tree!<br>
        And may fause Luver staw my rose,<br>
          But ah! he left the thorn wi’ me.

      <h2>Lament for James, Earl of Glencairn</h2>

      <p>
        THE WIND blew hollow frae the hills,<br>
          By fits the sun’s departing beam<br>
        Look’d on the fading yellow woods,<br>
          That wav’d o’er Lugar’s winding stream:<br>
        Beneath a craigy steep, a Bard,<br>
          Laden with years and meikle pain,<br>
        In loud lament bewail’d his lord,<br>
          Whom Death had all untimely ta’en.
      </p>

      <p>
        He lean’d him to an ancient aik,<br>
          Whose trunk was mould’ring down with years;<br>
        His locks were bleached white with time,<br>
          His hoary cheek was wet wi’ tears!<br>
        And as he touch’d his trembling harp,<br>
          And as he tun’d his doleful sang,<br>
        The winds, lamenting thro’ their caves,<br>
          To Echo bore the notes alang.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ye scatter’d birds that faintly sing,<br>
          The reliques o’ the vernal queir!<br>
        Ye woods that shed on a’ the winds<br>
          The honours of the agèd year!<br>
        A few short months, and glad and gay,<br>
          Again ye’ll charm the ear and e’e;<br>
        But nocht in all-revolving time<br>
          Can gladness bring again to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I am a bending agèd tree,<br>
          That long has stood the wind and rain;<br>
        But now has come a cruel blast,<br>
          And my last hald of earth is gane;<br>
        Nae leaf o’ mine shall greet the spring,<br>
          Nae simmer sun exalt my bloom;<br>
        But I maun lie before the storm,<br>
          And ithers plant them in my room.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve seen sae mony changefu’ years,<br>
          On earth I am a stranger grown:<br>
        I wander in the ways of men,<br>
          Alike unknowing, and unknown:<br>
        Unheard, unpitied, unreliev’d,<br>
          I bear alane my lade o’ care,<br>
        For silent, low, on beds of dust,<br>
          Lie a’ that would my sorrows share.
      </p>

      <p>
        “And last, (the sum of a’ my griefs!)<br>
          My noble master lies in clay;<br>
        The flow’r amang our barons bold,<br>
          His country’s pride, his country’s stay:<br>
        In weary being now I pine,<br>
          For a’ the life of life is dead,<br>
        And hope has left may aged ken,<br>
          On forward wing for ever fled.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Awake thy last sad voice, my harp!<br>
          The voice of woe and wild despair!<br>
        Awake, resound thy latest lay,<br>
          Then sleep in silence evermair!<br>
        And thou, my last, best, only, friend,<br>
          That fillest an untimely tomb,<br>
        Accept this tribute from the Bard<br>
          Thou brought from Fortune’s mirkest gloom.
      </p>

      <p>
        “In Poverty’s low barren vale,<br>
          Thick mists obscure involv’d me round;<br>
        Though oft I turn’d the wistful eye,<br>
          Nae ray of fame was to be found:<br>
        Thou found’st me, like the morning sun<br>
          That melts the fogs in limpid air,<br>
        The friendless bard and rustic song<br>
          Became alike thy fostering care.
      </p>

      <p>
        “O! why has worth so short a date,<br>
          While villains ripen grey with time?<br>
        Must thou, the noble, gen’rous, great,<br>
          Fall in bold manhood’s hardy prim<br>
        Why did I live to see that day—<br>
          A day to me so full of woe?<br>
        O! had I met the mortal shaft<br>
          That laid my benefactor low!
      </p>

      <p>
        “The bridegroom may forget the bride<br>
          Was made his wedded wife yestreen;<br>
        The monarch may forget the crown<br>
          That on his head an hour has been;<br>
        The mother may forget the child<br>
          That smiles sae sweetly on her knee;<br>
        But I’ll remember thee, Glencairn,<br>
          And a’ that thou hast done for me!”
      </p>

      <h2>Lines to Sir John Whitefoord, Bart</h2>

      <h2>With the Lament on the Death of the Earl of Glencairn</h2>

      <p>
        THOU, who thy honour as thy God rever’st,<br>
        Who, save thy mind’s reproach, nought earthly fear’st,<br>
        To thee this votive offering I impart,<br>
        The tearful tribute of a broken heart.<br>
        The Friend thou valued’st, I, the Patron lov’d;<br>
        His worth, his honour, all the world approved:<br>
        We’ll mourn till we too go as he has gone,<br>
        And tread the shadowy path to that dark world unknown.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—Craigieburn Wood</h2>

      <p>
        SWEET closes the ev’ning on Craigieburn Wood,<br>
          And blythely awaukens the morrow;<br>
        But the pride o’ the spring in the Craigieburn Wood<br>
          Can yield to me nothing but sorrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chorus.—Beyond thee, dearie, beyond thee, dearie,<br>
          And O to be lying beyond thee!<br>
        O sweetly, soundly, weel may he sleep<br>
          That’s laid in the bed beyond thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        I see the spreading leaves and flowers,<br>
          I hear the wild birds singing;<br>
        But pleasure they hae nane for me,<br>
          While care my heart is wringing.<br>
              Beyond thee, &c.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can na tell, I maun na tell,<br>
          I daur na for your anger;<br>
        But secret love will break my heart,<br>
          If I conceal it langer.<br>

      <p>
        I see thee gracefu’, straight and tall,<br>
          I see thee sweet and bonie;<br>
        But oh, what will my torment be,<br>
          If thou refuse thy Johnie!<br>
              Beyond thee, &c.

      <h2>Epigram on Miss Davies</h2>

      <h3>On being asked why she had been formed so little, and Mrs. A—— so big.</h3>

      <p>
        ASK why God made the gem so small?<br>
        And why so huge the granite?—<br>
        Because God meant mankind should set<br>
        That higher value on it.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—The Charms of Lovely Davies</h2>

      <h3>Tune—“Miss Muir.”</h3>

      <p>
        O HOW shall I, unskilfu’, try<br>
          The poet’s occupation?<br>
        The tunefu’ powers, in happy hours,<br>
          That whisper inspiration;<br>
        Even they maun dare an effort mair<br>
          Than aught they ever gave us,<br>
        Ere they rehearse, in equal verse,<br>
          The charms o’ lovely Davies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each eye it cheers when she appears,<br>
          Like Phoebus in the morning,<br>
        When past the shower, and every flower<br>
          The garden is adorning:<br>
        As the wretch looks o’er Siberia’s shore,<br>
          When winter-bound the wave is;<br>
        Sae droops our heart, when we maun part<br>
          Frae charming, lovely Davies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her smile’s a gift frae ’boon the lift,<br>
          That maks us mair than princes;<br>
        A sceptred hand, a king’s command,<br>
          Is in her darting glances;<br>
        The man in arms ’gainst female charms<br>
          Even he her willing slave is,<br>
        He hugs his chain, and owns the reign<br>
          Of conquering, lovely Davies.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Muse, to dream of such a theme,<br>
          Her feeble powers surrender:<br>
        The eagle’s gaze alone surveys<br>
          The sun’s meridian splendour.<br>
        I wad in vain essay the strain,<br>
          The deed too daring brave is;<br>
        I’ll drap the lyre, and mute admire<br>
          The charms o’ lovely Davies.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—What can a Young Lassie do wi’ an Auld Man?</h2>

      <p>
        WHAT can a young lassie, what shall a young lassie,<br>
          What can a young lassie do wi’ an auld man?<br>
        Bad luck on the penny that tempted my minnie<br>

      <h2>Song—The Posie</h2>

      <p>
        O LUVE will venture in where it daur na weel be seen,<br>
        O luve will venture in where wisdom ance has been;<br>
        But I will doun yon river rove, amang the wood sae green,<br>
              And a’ to pu’ a Posie to my ain dear May.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primrose I will pu’, the firstling o’ the year,<br>
        And I will pu’ the pink, the emblem o’ my dear;<br>
        For she’s the pink o’ womankind, and blooms without a peer,<br>
              And a’ to be a Posie to my ain dear May.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll pu’ the budding rose, when Phoebus peeps in view,<br>
        For it’s like a baumy kiss o’ her sweet, bonie mou;<br>
        The hyacinth’s for constancy wi’ its unchanging blue,<br>
              And a’ to be a Posie to my ain dear May.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lily it is pure, and the lily it is fair,<br>
        And in her lovely bosom I’ll place the lily there;<br>
        The daisy’s for simplicity and unaffected air,<br>
              And a’ to be a Posie to my ain dear May.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hawthorn I will pu’, wi’ its locks o’ siller gray,<br>
        Where, like an aged man, it stands at break o’ day;<br>
        But the songster’s nest within the bush I winna tak away<br>
              And a’ to be a Posie to my ain dear May.
      </p>

      <p>
        The woodbine I will pu’, when the e’ening star is near,<br>
        And the diamond draps o’ dew shall be her een sae clear;<br>
        The violet’s for modesty, which weel she fa’s to wear,<br>
              And a’ to be a Posie to my ain dear May.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll tie the Posie round wi’ the silken band o’ luve,<br>
        And I’ll place it in her breast, and I’ll swear by a’ above,<br>
        That to my latest draught o’ life the band shall ne’er remove,<br>
              And this will be a Posie to my ain dear May.
