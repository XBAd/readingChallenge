        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton" target="_blank">John Milton</a>
           (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet and intellectual,
           who served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England
           under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell.
           He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval,
           and is best known for his epic poem <em>Paradise Lost (1667)</em>,
           written in blank verse. Writing in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian,
           he achieved international renown within his lifetime,
           and his celebrated <em>Areopagitica (1644)</em>, written in condemnation
           of pre-publication censorship, is among history's most influential
           and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
           His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced
           new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and
           was the first modern writer to employ non-rhymed verse outside
           of the theatre or translations.

      <h2>L’Allegro (1633)</h2>

      <p>
        HENCE, loathèd Melancholy, <br>

          There under <span class="tooltip">ebon<span class="tooltiptext">dark brown or black; ebony.</span></span> shades, and low-browed rocks,<br>
        As ragged as thy locks,<br>

        As he met her once a-Maying,<br>
        There on beds of violets blue,<br>
        And fresh-blown roses washed in dew,<br>
        Filled her with thee, a daughter fair,<br>
        So buxom, blithe and debonair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee<br>
      Jest and youthful Jollity,<br>
      Quips, and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,<br>
      Nods, and Becks, and wreathèd Smiles,<br>
      Such as hang on <span class="tooltip">Hebe’s<span class="tooltiptext">Hebe was the goddess of youth, daughter of Zeus and Hera. She served nectar and ambrosia to the Olympians</span></span> cheek,<br>
      And love to live in dimple sleek;<br>

      And Laughter holding both his sides.<br>
      Come, and trip it as ye go,<br>
      On the light fantastic toe;<br>
      And in thy right hand lead with thee<br>
      The mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;<br>
      And, if I give thee honour due,<br>
      Mirth, admit me of thy crew,<br>
      To live with her, and live with thee,<br>
      In unreprovèd pleasures free;<br>
      To hear the lark begin his flight,<br>
      And singing startle the dull night,<br>
      From his watch-tower in the skies,<br>
      Till the dappled Dawn doth rise;<br>
      Then to come, in spite of sorrow,<br>
      And at my window bid good-morrow,<br>
      Through the sweet-briar or the vine,<br>
      Or the twisted <span class="tooltip">eglantine<span class="tooltiptext">a European rose ( Rosa eglanteria) with hooked spines, sweet-scented leaves, and usually pink flowers; sweetbrier</span></span>;<br>
      While the cock with lively din<br>
      Scatters the rear of Darkness thin;<br>
      And to the stack, or the barn-door,<br>
      Stoutly struts his dames before:<br>
      Oft listening how the hounds and horn<br>
      Cheerily rouse the slumbering Morn,<br>
      From the side of some <span class="tooltip">hoar<span class="tooltiptext">ancient; gray or white</span></span> hill,<br>
      Through the high wood echoing shrill:<br>
      Sometime walking, not unseen,<br>
      By hedgerow elms, on hillocks green,<br>
      Right against the eastern gate,<br>
      Where the great Sun begins his state,<br>
      Robed in flames and amber light,<br>
      The clouds in thousand liveries <span class="tooltip">dight<span class="tooltiptext">clothed or equipped.</span></span>;<br>
      While the ploughman, near at hand,<br>
      Whistles o’er the furrowed land,<br>
      And the milkmaid singeth blithe,<br>
      And the mower whets his scythe,<br>
      And every shepherd tells his tale<br>
      Under the hawthorn in the dale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,<br>
      Whilst the <span class="tooltip">lantskip<span class="tooltiptext">obsolete variant of landscape</span></span> round it measures:<br>
      Russet lawns, and <span class="tooltip">fallows<span class="tooltiptext">uncultivated lands</span></span> gray,<br>
      Where the nibbling flocks do stray;<br>
      Mountains on whose barren breast<br>
      The labouring clouds do often rest;<br>
      Meadows trim with daisies pied;<br>
      Shallow brooks, and rivers wide.<br>
      Towers and battlements it sees<br>
      Bosomed high in tufted trees,<br>
      Where perhaps some Beauty lies,<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">Cynosure<span class="tooltiptext">a person or thing that is the center of attention or admiration; the northern constellation Ursa Minor; The North Star</span></span> of neighbouring eyes.<br>
      Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes<br>
      From betwixt two aged oaks,<br>
      Where <span class="tooltip">Corydon and Thyrsis<span class="tooltiptext">shepherds in ancient Greek pastoral poems and fables</span></span> met<br>
      Are at their savoury dinner set<br>
      Of hearbs and other country messes,<br>
      Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;<br>
      And then in haste her bower she leaves,<br>
      With Thestylis to bind the sheaves;<br>
      Or, if the earlier season lead,<br>
      To the tanned haycock in the mead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes with secure delight<br>
      The upland hamlets will invite,<br>
      When the merry bells ring round,<br>
      And the jocond <span class="tooltip">rebecks<span class="tooltiptext">a medieval stringed instrument played with a bow, typically having three strings.</span></span> sound<br>
      To many a youth and many a maid<br>
      Dancing in the chequered shade;<br>
      And young and old come forth to play<br>
      On a sunshine holyday,<br>
      Till the livelong daylight fail:<br>
      Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,<br>
      With stories told of many a feat,<br>
      How fairy Mab the junkets eat:<br>
      She was pinched and pulled, she said;<br>
      And he, by Friar’s lanthorn led,<br>
      Tells how the drudging Goblin sweat<br>
      To earn his cream-bowl duly set,<br>
      When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,<br>
      His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn<br>
      That ten day-labourers could not end;<br>
      Then lies him down, the lubber fiend,<br>
      And, stretched out all the chimney’s length,<br>
      Basks at the fire his hairy strength,<br>
      And crop-full out of doors he flings,<br>
      Ere the first cock his matin rings.<br>
      Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,<br>
      By whispering winds soon lulled asleep.<br>
      Towered cities please us then,<br>
      And the busy hum of men,<br>
      Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,<br>
      In weeds of peace, high triumphs hold,<br>
      With store of Ladies, whose bright eyes<br>
      Rain influence, and judge the prize<br>
      Of wit or arms, while both contend<br>
      Of win her grace whom all commend.<br>
      There let Hymen oft appear<br>
      In saffron robe, with taper clear,<br>
      And pomp, and feast, and revelry,<br>
      With mask and antique pageantry;<br>
      Such sights as youthful Poets dream<br>
      On summer eves by haunted stream.<br>
      Then to the well-trod stage anon,<br>
      If Johnson’s learned sock be on,<br>
      Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy’s child,<br>
      Warble his native wood-notes wild.<br>
      And ever, against eating cares,<br>
      Lap me in soft <span class="tooltip">Lydian<span class="tooltiptext">Of or relating to Lydia or its people, language, or culture; soft; gentle</span></span> airs,<br>
      Married to immortal verse,<br>
      Such as the meeting soul may pierce,<br>
      In notes with many a winding bout<br>
      Of linkèd sweetness long drawn out<br>
      With wanton heed and giddy cunning,<br>
      The melting voice through mazes running,<br>
      Untwisting all the chains that tie<br>
      The hidden soul of harmony;<br>
      That Orpheus’ self may heave his head<br>
      From golden slumber on a bed<br>
      Of heaped Elysian flowers, and hear<br>
      Such strains as would have won the ear<br>
      Of Pluto to have quite set free<br>
      His half-regained Eurydice.<br>
      These delights if thou canst give,<br>
      Mirth, with thee I mean to live.

      <h2>Il Penseroso (1633)</h2>

      <p>
        HENCE, vain deluding Joys,<br>
          The brood of Folly without father bred!<br>
        How little you bested,<br>
          Or fill the fixèd mind with all your toys!<br>
        Dwell in some idle brain,<br>
          And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,<br>
        As thick and numberless<br>
          As the gay <span class="tooltip">motes<span class="tooltiptext">small particles; specks</span></span> that people the sunbeams,<br>
        Or likest hovering dreams,<br>
          The fickle pensioners of Morpheus’ train.<br>
        But hail! thou Goddess sage and holy!<br>
        Hail, divinest Melancholy!<br>
        Whose saintly visage is too bright<br>
        To hit the sense of human sight,<br>
        And therefore to our weaker view<br>
        O’erlaid with black, staid Wisdom’s hue;<br>
        Black, but such as in esteem<br>
        Prince <span class="tooltip">Memnon’s<span class="tooltiptext">In Greek mythology, Memnon was an Ethiopian king and son of Tithonus and Eos. As a warrior he was considered to be almost Achilles' equal in skill.</span></span> sister might beseem,<br>
        Or that starred Ethiop Queen that strove<br>
        To set her beauty’s praise above<br>
        The Sea-Nymphs, and their powers offended.<br>
        Yet thou art higher far descended:<br>
        Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore<br>
        To solitary Saturn bore;<br>
        His daughter she; in Saturn’s reign<br>
        Such mixture was not held a stain.<br>
        Oft in glimmering bowers and glades<br>
        He met her, and in secret shades<br>
        Of woody Ida’s inmost grove,<br>
        Whilst yet there was no fear of Jove.<br>
        Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,<br>
        Sober, steadfast, and demure,<br>
        All in a robe of darkest grain,<br>
        Flowing with majestic train,<br>
        And sable stole of cypress lawn<br>
        Over thy decent shoulders drawn.<br>
        Come; but keep thy <span class="tooltip">wonted<span class="tooltiptext">habitual; usual.</span></span> state,<br>
        With even step, and musing gait,<br>
        And looks commercing with the skies,<br>
        Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:<br>
        There, held in holy passion still,<br>
        Forget thyself to marble, till<br>
        With a sad leaden downward cast<br>
        Thou fix them on the earth as fast.<br>
        And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet,<br>
        Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,<br>
        And hears the Muses in a ring<br>
        Aye round about Jove’s altar sing;<br>
        And add to these retirèd Leisure,<br>
        That in trim gardens takes his pleasure;<br>
        But, first and chieftest, with thee bring<br>
        Him that yon soars on golden wing,<br>
        Guiding the fiery-wheelèd throne,<br>
        The Cherub Contemplation;<br>
        And the mute Silence hist along,<br>
        ’Less Philomel will deign a song,<br>
        In her sweetest saddest plight,<br>
        Smoothing the rugged brow of Night,<br>
        While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke<br>
        Gently o’er the accustomed oak.<br>
        Sweet bird, that shunn’st the noise of folly,<br>
        Most musical, most melancholy!<br>
        Thee, Chauntress, oft the woods among<br>
        I woo, to hear they even-song;<br>
        And, missing thee, I walk unseen<br>
        On the dry smooth-shaven green,<br>
        To behold the wandering Moon,<br>
        Riding near her highest noon,<br>
        Like one that had been led astray<br>
        Through the heaven’s wide pathless way,<br>
        And oft, as if her head she bowed,<br>
        Stooping through a fleecy cloud.<br>
        Oft, on a plat of rising ground,<br>
        I hear the far-off curfew sound,<br>
        Over some wide-watered shore,<br>
        Swinging slow with sullen roar;<br>
        Or, if the air will not permit,<br>
        Some still removèd place will fit,<br>
        Where glowing embers through the room<br>
        Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,<br>
        Far from all resort of mirth,<br>
        Save the cricket on the hearth,<br>
        Or the Bellman’s drowsy charm<br>
        To bless the doors from nightly harm.<br>
        Or let my lamp, at midnight hour,<br>
        Be seen in some high lonely tower,<br>
        Where I may oft outwatch the Bear,<br>
        With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere<br>
        The spirit of Plato, to unfold<br>
        What worlds or what vast regions hold<br>
        The immortal mind that hath forsook<br>
        Her mansion in this fleshly nook;<br>
        And of those Dæmons that are found<br>
        In fire, air, flood, or underground,<br>
        Whose power hath a true consent<br>
        With planet or with element.<br>
        Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy<br>
        In sceptred pall come sweeping by,<br>
        Presenting Thebs, or Pelops’ line,<br>
        Or the tale of Troy divine,<br>
        Or what (though rare) or later age<br>
        Ennobled hath the <span class="tooltip">buskined<span class="tooltiptext">of, relating to, or befitting tragedy, especially in the manner of tragic drama.</span></span> stage.<br>
        But, O sad Virgin! that thy power<br>
        Might raise <span class="tooltip">Musæus<span class="tooltiptext">a legendary polymath, philosopher, historian, prophet, seer, priest, poet, and musician, said to have been the founder of priestly poetry in Attica</span></span> from his bower;<br>
        Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing<br>
        Such notes as, warbled to the string,<br>
        Drew iron tears down Pluto’s cheek,<br>
        And made Hell grant what Love did seek;<br>
        Or call up him that left half-told<br>
        The story of Cambuscan bold,<br>
        Of Camball, and of Algarsife,<br>
        And who had Canace to wife,<br>
        That owned the virtuous ring and glass,<br>
        And of the wondrous horse of brass<br>
        On which the Tartar King did ride;<br>
        And if aught else great Bards beside<br>
        In sage and solemn tunes have sung,<br>
        Of turneys, and of trophies hung,<br>
        Of forests, and inchantments drear,<br>
        Where more is meant than meets the ear.<br>
        Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career,<br>
        Till civil-suited Morn appear,<br>
        Not tricked and frounced, as she wont<br>
        With the Attic boy to hunt,<br>
        But kerchieft in a comely cloud,<br>
        While rocking winds are piping loud,<br>
        Or ushered with a shower still,<br>
        When the gust hath blown his fill,<br>
        Ending on the rustling leaves,<br>
        With minute drops from off the eaves.<br>
        And, when the sun begins to fling<br>
        His flaring beams, me, Goddess, bring<br>
        To archèd walks of twilight groves,<br>
        And shadows brown, that <span class="tooltip">Sylvan<span class="tooltiptext">Silvanus (meaning "of the woods" in Latin) was a Roman tutelary deity of woods and fields. As protector of the forest (sylvestris deus), he especially presided over plantations and delighted in trees growing wild.</span></span> loves,<br>
        Of pine, or monumental oak,<br>
        Where the rude axe with heaved stroke<br>
        Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,<br>
        Or fright them from their hallowed haunt.<br>
        There, in close covert, by some brook,<br>
        Where no profaner eye may look,<br>
        Hide me from Day’s garish eye,<br>
        While the bee with honeyed thigh,<br>
        That at her flowery work doth sing,<br>
        And the waters murmuring,<br>
        With such consort as they keep,<br>
        Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep.<br>
        And let some strange mysterious dream,<br>
        Wave at his wings in airy stream,<br>
        Of lively portraiture displayed,<br>
        Softly on my eyelids laid.<br>
        And as I wake, sweet music breathe<br>
        Above, about, or underneath,<br>
        Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,<br>
        Or the unseen Genius of the wood.<br>
        But let my due feet never fail<br>
        To walk the studious cloister’s pale,<br>
        And love the high embowèd roof,<br>
        With antick pillars massy proof,<br>
        And storied windows richly dight,<br>
        Casting a dim religious light.<br>
        There let the pealing organ blow,<br>
        To the full voiced Quire below,<br>
        In service high and anthems clear,<br>
        As may with sweetness, through mine ear,<br>
        Dissolve me into ecstasies,<br>
        And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.<br>
        And may at last my weary age<br>
        Find out the peaceful hermitage,<br>
        The hairy gown and mossy cell,<br>
        Where I may sit and rightly spell,<br>
        Of every star that Heaven doth shew,<br>
        And every hearb that sips the dew;<br>
        Till old experience do attain<br>
        To something like prophetic strain.<br>
        These pleasures, Melancholy, give<br>
        And I with thee will choose to live.
