          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(play)" target="_blank">The Alchemist</a>
           is a comedy by English playwright Ben Jonson.
           First performed in 1610 by the King's Men (the acting company to which Shakespeare belonged for most of his career),
           it is generally considered Jonson's best and most characteristic comedy;
           Samuel Taylor Coleridge considered it had one of the three most perfect
           plots in literature. The play's clever fulfilment of the classical
           unities (a prescriptive theory of dramatic tragedy) and vivid depiction of human folly have made it one of the few
           Renaissance plays (except the works of Shakespeare) with a continuing
           life on stage (except for a period of neglect during the Victorian era).

        DOL.  Nay, look ye, sovereign, general, are you madmen?
      </p>

      <p>

        SUB.        Yes, faith; yes, faith.
      </p>

        FACE.        Why, who<br>
      Am I, my mongrel, who am I?
      </p>

        SUB.        I’ll tell you.,<br>
      Since you know not yourself.

      <p>
        FACE.        Speak lower, rogue.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Yes, you were once (time’s not long past) the good,<br>
      Honest, plain, livery-three-pound-thrum, that kept<br>
      Your master’s worship’s house here in the Friars,<br>
      For the vacations——

        FACE.        Why, I pray you, have I<br>
      Been countenanc’d by you, or you by me?<br>
      Do but collect, sir, where I met you first.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  I do not hear well.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Not of this, I think it.<br>
      But I shall put you in mind, sir;—at Pie-corner,<br>
      Taking your meal of steam in, from cooks’ stalls,<br>
      Where, like the father of hunger, you did walk<br>
      Piteously <span class="tooltip">costive<span class="tooltiptext">slow or reluctant in speech or action; unforthcoming.</span></span>, with your pinch’d-horn-nose,<br>
      And your complexion of the Roman wash,<br>
      Stuck full of black and melancholic worms,<br>
      Like powder-corns shot at the artillery-yard.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  I wish you could advance your voice a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  When you went pinn’d up in the several rags;<br>
      You had rak’d and pick’d from dunghills, before day;<br>
      Your feet in mouldy slippers, for your <span class="tooltip">kibes<span class="tooltiptext">A chapped or inflamed area on the skin, especially on the heel, resulting from exposure to cold</span></span>;<br>
      A felt of rug, and a thin threaden cloak,<br>
      That scarce would cover your no-buttocks——
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        So, sir!
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  When all your alchemy, and your algebra,<br>
      Your minerals, vegetals, and animals,<br>
      Your conjuring, <span class="tooltip">coz’ning<span class="tooltiptext">tricking, deceiving, or cheating</span></span>; and your dozen of trades,<br>
      Could not relieve your corpse with so much linen<br>
      Would make you tinder, but to see a fire;<br>
      I ga’ you count’nance, credit for your coals,<br>
      Your stills, your glasses, your materials;<br>
      Built you a furnace, drew you customers,<br>
      Advanc’d all your black arts; lent you, beside,<br>
      A house to practise in——
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Your master’s house!

      Of bawdry since.

        SUB.        Yes, in your master’s house.<br>
      You and the rats here kept possession.<br>
      Make it not strange. I know you were one could keep<br>
      The buttery-hatch still lock’d, and save the chippings,<br>
      Sell the dole beer to <span class="tooltip">aqua-vitae<span class="tooltiptext">a strong alcoholic liquor (such as brandy)</span></span> men,<br>
      The which, together with your Christmas vails<br>
      At post-and-pair, your letting out of counters,<br>
      Made you a pretty stock, some twenty marks,<br>
      And gave you credit to converse with cobwebs,<br>
      Here, since your mistress’ death hath broke up house.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  You might talk softlier, rascal.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        No, you scarab,<br>
      I’ll thunder you in pieces: I will teach you<br>
      How to beware to tempt a Fury again<br>
      That carries tempest in his hand and voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  The place has made you valiant.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        No, your clothes.<br>
      Thou vermin, have I ta’en thee out of dung,<br>
      So poor, so wretched, when no living thing<br>
      Would keep thee company, but a spider or worse?<br>
      Rais’d thee from brooms, and dust, and wat’ring-pots,<br>
      Sublim’d thee, and exalted thee, and fix’d thee<br>
      In the third region, call’d our state of grace?<br>
      Wrought thee to spirit, to quintessence, with pains<br>
      Would twice have won me the philosopher’s work?<br>
      Put thee in words and fashion, made thee fit<br>
      For more than ordinary fellowships?<br>
      Giv’n thee thy oaths, thy quarelling dimensions,<br>
      Thy rules to cheat, at horse-race, cock-pit, cards,<br>
      Dice, or whatever gallant tincture else?<br>
      Made thee a second in mine own great art?<br>
      And have I this for thanks! Do you rebel?<br>
      Do you fly out i’ the projection?<br>
      Would you be gone now?
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.        Gentlemen, what mean you?<br>
      Will you mar all?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Slave, thou hadst had no name——
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  Will you undo yourselves with civil war?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Never been known, past equi clibanum,<br>
      The heat of horse-dung, under ground, in cellars,<br>
      Or an ale-house darker than deaf John’s; been lost<br>
      To all mankind, but laundresses and tapsters,<br>
      Had not I been.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.        Do you know who hears you, sovereign?
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Sirrah——
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  Nay, general, I thought you were civil.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  I shall turn desperate, if you grow thus loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  And hang thyself, I care not.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Hang thee, <span class="tooltip">collier<span class="tooltiptext">a coal miner.</span></span>,<br>
      And all thy pots and pans, in picture, I will,<br>
      Since thou hast mov’d me——
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  [Aside]        O, this’ll o’erthrow all.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Write thee up bawd in Paul’s, have all thy tricks<br>
      Of coz’ning with a hollow coal, dust, scrapings,<br>
      Searching for things lost, with a sieve and shears,<br>
      Erecting figures in your rows of houses,<br>
      And taking in of shadows with a glass,<br>
      Told in red letters; and a face cut for thee,<br>
      Worse than Gamaliel Ratsey’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.        Are you sound?<br>
      Ha’ you your senses, masters?
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        I will have<br>
      A book, but barely reckoning thy impostures,<br>
      Shall prove a true philosopher’s stone to printers.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Away, you trencher-rascal!
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Out, you dog-leech!<br>
      The vomit of all prisons——
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.        Will you be<br>
      Your own destructions, gentlemen?
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Still spew’d out<br>
      For lying too heavy on the basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Cheater!
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Bawd!
      </p>

        DOL.        O me!<br>
      We are ruin’d, lost! Ha’ you no more regard<br>
      To your reputations? Where’s your judgment? ’Slight,<br>
      Have yet some care of me, o’ your republic——
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Away, this brach! I’ll bring thee, rogue, within<br>
      The statute of sorcery, tricesimo tertio<br>
      Of Harry the Eighth: ay, and perhaps thy neck<br>
      Within a noose, for laund’ring gold and barbing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  You’ll bring your head within a cockscomb, will you?  She catcheth out FACE his sword, and breaks SUBTLE’S glass.<br>
      And you, sir, with your menstrue! —Gather it up.<br>
      ’Sdeath, you abominable pair of stinkards,<br>
      Leave off your barking, and grow one again,<br>
      Or, by the light that shines, I’ll cut your throats.<br>
      I’ll not be made a prey unto the marshal<br>
      For ne’er a snarling dog-bolt of you both.<br>
      Ha’ you together cozen’d all this while,<br>
      And all the world, and shall it now be said,<br>
      You’ve made most courteous shift to cozen yourselves?
      </p>

      <p>
        [To FACE.]  You will accuse him! You will “bring him in<br>
      Within the statute!” Who shall take your word?<br>
      A whoreson, upstart, <span class="tooltip">apocryphal<span class="tooltiptext">(of a story or statement) of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true.</span></span> captain,<br>
      Whom not a Puritan in Blackfriars will trust<br>
      So much as for a feather: and you, too,  [to SUBTLE.]<br>
      Will give the cause, forsooth! You will insult,<br>
      And claim a primacy in the divisions!<br>
      You must be chief! As if you only had<br>
      The powder to project with, and the work<br>
      Were not begun out of equality!<br>
      The venture <span class="tooltip">tripartite<span class="tooltiptext">shared by or involving three parties; consisting of three parts.</span></span>! All things in common!<br>
      Without priority! ’Sdeath! you perpetual curs,<br>
      Fall to your couples again, and cozen kindly,<br>
      And heartily, and lovingly, as you should,<br>
      And lose not the beginning of a term,<br>
      Or, by this hand, I shall grow factious too,<br>
      And take my part, and quit you.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        ’Tis his fault;<br>
      He ever murmurs, and objects his pains,<br>
      And says, the weight of all lies upon him.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Why, so it does.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.        How does it? Do not we<br>
      Sustain our parts?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Yes, but they are not equal.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  Why, if your part exceed today, I hope<br>
      Ours may to-morrow match it.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Ay, they may.

      Help me to throttle him.  [Seizes SUB. by the throat.]

      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
        DOL.        Your Sol and Luna——help me.  [To FACE.]
      </p>

        SUB.  Would I were hang’d then! I’ll conform myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  Will you, sir? Do so then, and quickly: swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  What should I swear?
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.        To leave your faction, sir,<br>
      And labour kindly in the common work.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Let me not breathe if I meant aught beside.<br>
      I only us’d those speeches as a spur<br>
      To him.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  I hope we need no spurs, sir. Do we?
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  ’Slid, prove today who shall shark best.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Agreed.

        SUB.        ’Slight, the knot<br>
      Shall grow the stronger for this breach, with me.  [They shake hands.]

        DOL.  Why, so, my good baboons! Shall we go make<br>
      A sort of sober, scurvy, precise neighbours,<br>
      That scarce have smil’d twice sin’ the king came in,<br>
      A feast of laughter at our follies? Rascals,<br>
      Would run themselves from breath, to see me ride,<br>
      Or you t’have but a hole to thrust your heads in,<br>
      For which you should pay ear-rent? No, agree.<br>
      And may Don Provost ride a feasting long,<br>
      In his old velvet jerkin and stain’d scarfs,<br>
      My noble sovereign, and worthy general,<br>
      Ere we contribute a new crewel garter<br>
      To his most worsted worship.

      Spoken like Claridiana, and thyself.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  For which at supper, thou shalt sit in triumph,<br>
      And not be styl’d Dol Common, but Dol Proper,<br>
      Dol Singular: the longest cut at night,<br>
      Shall draw thee for his Dol Particular.  [Bell rings without.]
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Who’s that? One rings. To the window, Dol:  [Exit DOL.]—pray  heav’n,<br>
      The master do not trouble us this quarter.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  O, fear not him. While there dies one a week<br>
      O’ the plague, he’s safe from thinking toward London.<br>
      Beside, he’s busy at his hop-yards now;<br>
      I had a letter from him. If he do,<br>
      He’ll send such word, for airing o’ the house,<br>
      As you shall have sufficient time to quit it:<br>
      Though we break up a fortnight, ’tis no matter.

      <p>
        DOL.        A fine young quodling.

      <p>
        FACE.  O,<br>
      My lawyer’s clerk, I lighted on last night,<br>
      In Holborn, at the Dagger. He would have<br>
      (I told you of him) a familiar,<br>
      To rifle with at horses, and win cups.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOL.  O, let him in.
      </p>

      Your robes on; I will meet him, as going out.

      <p>
        DOL.  And what shall I do?

        Good faith, sir, I was going away.

      I am very sorry, captain.

      <p>
        FACE.        But I thought<br>
      Sure I should meet you.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        Ay, I am very glad.<br>
      I had a scurvy writ or two to make,<br>
      And I had lent my watch last night to one<br>
      That dines today at the sheriff’s, and so was robb’d<br>
      Of my pass-time.

      <p>
        DAP.        And how?

      I know not what to say.

      <p>
        DAP.        Not so, good captain.

      <p>
        FACE.  Would I were fairly rid on’t, believe me.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.  Nay, now you grieve me, sir. Why should you wish so?<br>
      I dare assure you, I’ll not be ungrateful.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  I cannot think you will, sir. But the law<br>
      Is such a thing——and then he says, Read’s matter<br>
      Falling so lately.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        Read! he was an ass,<br>
      And dealt, sir, with a fool.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        It was a clerk, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.  A clerk!
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Nay, hear me, sir. You know the law<br>
      Better, I think——
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        I should, sir, and the danger:<br>
      You know, I show’d the statute to you.

      <p>
        FACE.        You did so.

      <p>
        DAP.  And will I tell then! By this hand of flesh,<br>
      Would it might never write good courthand more,<br>
      If discover. What do you think of me,<br>

      <p>
        FACE.        What’s that?
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        The Turk was, here—<br>
      As one would say, do you think I am a Turk?
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  I’ll tell the doctor so.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        Do, good sweet captain.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Come, noble doctor, pray thee let’s prevail;<br>
      This is the gentleman, and he is no chiaus.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Captain, I have return’d you all my answer.<br>
      I would do much, sir, for your love—— But this<br>
      I neither may, nor can.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Tut, do not say so.<br>
      You deal now with a noble fellow, doctor,<br>
      One that will thank you richly; and he is no chiaus:<br>
      Let that, sir, move you.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Pray you, forbear——
      </p>

        FACE.        He has<br>
      Four angels here.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        You do me wrong, good sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Doctor, wherein? To tempt you with these spirits?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  To tempt my art and love, sir, to my peril.<br>
      ’Fore heav’n, I scarce can think you are my friend,<br>
      That so would draw me to apparent danger.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  I draw you! A horse draw you, and a <span class="tooltip">halter<span class="tooltiptext">a rope or strap for leading or tying an animal</span></span>,<br>
      You, and your flies together——
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        Nay, good captain.

      <p>
        SUB.        Good words, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Good deeds, sir, doctor dogs’-meat. ’Slight, I bring you<br>
      No cheating Clim o’ the Cloughs or Claribels,<br>

      <p>
        DAP.        Captain!

      <p>
        FACE.  Nor any melancholic underscribe,<br>
      Shall tell the vicar; but a special gentle,<br>
      That is the heir to forty marks a year,<br>
      Consorts with the small poets of the time,<br>

      That knows the law, and writes you six fair hands,<br>
      Is a fine clerk, and has his ciph’ring perfect.<br>
      Will take his oath o’ the Greek Xenophon,<br>
      If need be, in his pocket; and can court<br>
      His mistress out of Ovid.

      <p>
        DAP.        Nay, dear captain——
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Did you not tell me so?
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        Yes; but I’d ha’ you<br>
      Use master doctor with some more respect.

      <p>
        FACE.  Hang him, proud stag, with his broad velvet head!—<br>

      <p>
        DAP.  His worship calls you, captain.

        FACE.        I am sorry<br>
      I e’er embark’d myself in such a business.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.  Nay, good sir; he did call you.

      <p>
        FACE.        Will he take then?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  First, hear me——
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Not a syllable, ’less you take.

      <p>
        SUB.  Pray ye, sir——
      </p>

        FACE.        Upon no terms but an assumpsit.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Your humour must be law.  He takes the money.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Why now, sir, talk.<br>
      Now I dare hear you with mine honour. Speak.<br>
      So may this gentleman too.

      <p>
        FACE.        No whispering.

      You do yourself in this.

      <p>
        FACE.        Wherein? for what?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  Marry, to be so importunate for one<br>
      That, when he has it, will undo you all:<br>
      He’ll win up all the money i’ the town.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  How?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.        Yes, and blow up gamester after gamester,<br>
      As they do crackers in a puppet-play.<br>
      If I do give him a familiar,<br>
      Give you him all you play for; never set him:<br>
      For he will have it.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        You’re mistaken, doctor.<br>
      Why, he does ask one but for cups and horses,<br>
      A rifling fly; none o’ your great familiars.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.  Yes, captain, I would have it for all games.

      <p>
        SUB.  I told you so.

      But I do think, now, I shall leave the law,<br>
      And therefore——

      Do you think that I dare move him?

      All’s one to him, to see.

      <p>
        FACE.  What! for that money?<br>
      I cannot with my conscience; nor should you<br>
      Make the request, methinks.
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        No, sir, I mean<br>
      To add consideration.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Why then, sir,<br>
      I’ll try.  [Goes to SUBTLE.] Say that it were for all games, doctor?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  I say then, not a mouth shall eat for him<br>
      At any ordinary, but on the score,<br>
      That is a gaming mouth, conceive me.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Indeed!

      If it be set him.

      He is of the only best complexion,<br>
      The queen of Fairy loves.

      <p>
        FACE.        Will he win at cards too?
      </p>

      <p>
        SUB.  The spirits of dead Holland, living Isaac,<br>
      You’d swear, were in him; such a vigorous lack<br>
      As cannot be resisted. ’Slight, he’ll put<br>
      Six of your gallants to a cloak, indeed.

        DAP.        Sir, I’ll not be ingrateful.

      You hear, he says he will not be ingrateful.

      <p>
        SUB.  Why, as you please; my venture follows yours.

        FACE.  Troth, do it, doctor; think him trusty, and make him.<br>
      He may make us both happy in an hour;<br>
      Win some five thousand pound, and send us two on’t.
      </p>

      You have heard all?

      Believe it, no such matter——

        FACE.        How!<br>
      Swear by your fac, and in a thing so known<br>
      Unto the doctor? How shall we, sir, trust you<br>
      I’ the other matter; can we ever think,<br>
      When you have won five or six thousand pound,<br>
      You’ll send us shares in’t by this rate?

      To take it so.

      <p>
        DAP.        I thank his worship.

      Another angel.

      What else is thanks? Will you be trivial?—Doctor,  [DAPPER gives him the money.]<br>
      When must he come for his familiar?
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.  Shall I not ha’ it with me?

      There must a world of ceremonies pass;<br>
      You must be bath’d and fumigated first:<br>
      Besides, the queen of Fairy does not rise<br>
      Till it be noon.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.        Not if she danc’d to-night.

        FACE.        Your aunt of Fairy?

      I can resolve you that.

      Whate’er it cost you, for a thing that I know.<br>
      It will be somewhat hard to compass; but<br>
      However, see her. You are made, believe it,<br>
      If you can see her. Her grace is a lone woman,<br>
      And very rich; and if she take a fancy,<br>
      She will do strange things. See her, at any hand.<br>
      ’Slid, she may hap to leave you all she has:<br>
      It is the doctor’s fear.

      But say to me, “Captain, I’ll see her grace.”

        Till when you must be fasting; only take<br>
        Three drops of vinegar in at your nose,<br>
        Two at your mouth, and one at either ear;<br>
        Then bathe your fingers’ ends and wash your eyes,<br>
        To sharpen your five senses, and cry hum<br>
        Thrice, and then buz as often; and then come.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Can you remember this?
      </p>

      <p>
        DAP.        I warrant you.
      </p>

      <p>
        FACE.  Well then, away. It is but your bestowing<br>
      Some twenty nobles ’mong her grace’s servants,<br>
      And put on a clean shirt. You do not know<br>
      What grace her grace may do you in clean linen.  [Exeunt FACE and DAPPER.]
