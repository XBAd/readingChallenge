      <h2>Act IV</h2>

      <h2>Scene IV</h2>

      <h3>[The same. A tent]</h3>

      <h3>Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>  Alack, ’tis he! Why, he was met even now <br>
      As mad as the vex’d sea, singing aloud,<br>
      Crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,<br>
      With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,<br>
      Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow<br>
      In our sustaining corn. A sentry send forth;<br>
      Search every acre in the high-grown field,<br>
      And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man’s wisdom<br>
      In the restoring his bereaved sense?<br>
      He that helps him take all my outward worth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Doct.</em>  There is means, madam.<br>
      Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,<br>
      The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,<br>
      Are many simples operative, whose power<br>
      Will close the eye of anguish.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>        All blest secrets,<br>
      All you unpublish’d virtues of the earth,<br>
      Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate<br>
      In the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him,<br>
      Lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life<br>
      That wants the means to lead it.
      </p>

      <h3>Enter a Messenger</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em>        News, madam!<br>
      The British powers are marching hitherward.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>  ’Tis known before; our preparation stands<br>
      In expectation of them. O dear father,<br>
      It is thy business that I go about;<br>
      Therefore great France<br>
      My mourning and importune tears hath pitied.<br>
      No blown ambition doth our arms incite,<br>
      But love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right.<br>
      Soon may I hear and see him!  Exeunt.
      </p>

      <h2>Scene V</h2>

      <h3>[Gloucester’s castle]</h3>

      <h3>Enter REGAN and Steward [OSWALD]</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  But are my brother’s powers set forth?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        Ay, madam.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  Himself in person there?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        Madam, with much ado.<br>
      Your sister is the better soldier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  No, madam.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  What might import my sister’s letter to him?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  I know not, lady.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.<br>
      It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,<br>
      To let him live; where he arrives he moves<br>
      All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,<br>
      In pity of his misery, to dispatch<br>
      His nighted life; moreover, to descry<br>
      The strength o’ the enemy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  Our troops set forth to-morrow, stay with us;<br>
      The ways are dangerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        I may not, madam:<br>
      My lady charg’d my duty in this business.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you<br>
      Transport her purposes by word? Belike<br>
      Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much,<br>
      Let me unseal the letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        Madam, I had rather—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  I know your lady does not love her husband;<br>
      I am sure of that; and at her late being here<br>
      She gave strange œillades and most speaking looks<br>
      To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  I, madam?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>  I speak in understanding; y’ are, I know ’t.<br>
      Therefore I do advise you, take this note:<br>
      My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d;<br>
      And more convenient is he for my hand<br>
      Than for your lady’s. You may gather more.<br>
      If you do find him, pray you, give him this;<br>
      And when your mistress hears thus much from you,<br>
      I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.<br>
      So, fare you well.<br>
      If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,<br>
      Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Would I could meet him, madam! I should show What party I do follow.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Reg.</em>        Fare thee well.  [Exeunt.]
      </p>

      <h2>Scene VI</h2>

      <h3>[Fields near Dover]</h3>

      <h3>Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR [dressed like a peasant]</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  When shall I come to the top of that same hill?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  You do climb up it now; look, how we labour.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Methinks the ground is even.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        Horrible steep.<br>
      Hark, do you hear the sea?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        No, truly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect<br>
      By your eyes’ anguish.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        So may it be, indeed.<br>
      Methinks thy voice is alter’d, and thou speak’st<br>
      In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  You’re much deceiv’d. In nothing am I chang’d<br>
      But in my garments.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Methinks you’re better spoken.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Come on, sir, here’s the place; stand still. How fearful<br>
      And dizzy ’tis, to cast one’s eyes so low!<br>
      The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br>
      Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down<br>
      Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!<br>
      Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.<br>
      The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,<br>
      Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br>
      Diminish’d to her cock; her cock, a buoy<br>
      Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,<br>
      That on the unnumb’red idle pebbles chafes,<br>
      Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,<br>
      Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight<br>
      Topple down headlong.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Set me where you stand.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Give me your hand; you are now within a foot<br>
      Of the extreme verge. For all beneath the moon<br>
      Would I not leap upright.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Let go my hand.<br>
      Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel<br>
      Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods<br>
      Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;<br>
      Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Now fare ye well, good sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        With all my heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Why I do trifle thus with his despair<br>
      Is done to cure it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  [Kneeling.]  O you mighty gods!<br>
      This world I do renounce, and in your sights<br>
      Shake patiently my great affliction off.<br>
      If I could bear it longer, and not fall<br>
      To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br>
      My snuff and loathed part of nature should<br>
      Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O bless him!<br>
      Now, fellow, fare thee well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        Gone, sir; farewell!<br>
      —And yet I know not how conceit may rob<br>
      The treasury of life, when life itself<br>
      Yields to the theft. [GLOU. throws himself forward.] Had he been where he thought,<br>
      By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?—<br>
      Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!—<br>
      Thus might he pass indeed; yet he revives.—<br>
      What are you, sir?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Away, and let me die.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,<br>
      So many fathom down precipitating,<br>
      Thou ’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;<br>
      Hast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art sound.<br>
      Ten masts at each make not the altitude<br>
      Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.<br>
      Thy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  But have I fallen, or no?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.<br>
      Look up a-height; the shrill-gorg’d lark so far<br>
      Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Alack, I have no eyes.<br>
      Is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit,<br>
      To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort,<br>
      When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage,<br>
      And frustrate his proud will.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        Give me your arm.<br>
      Up: so. How is ’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Too well, too well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        This is above all strangeness.<br>
      Upon the crown o’ the cliff, what thing was that<br>
      Which parted from you?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        A poor unfortunate beggar.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br>
      Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br>
      Horns whelk’d and waved like the enridged sea.<br>
      It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,<br>
      Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br>
      Of men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  I do remember now. Henceforth I’ll bear<br>
      Affliction till it do cry out itself,<br>
      “Enough, enough,” and die. That thing you speak of,<br>
      I took it for a man; often ’twould say,<br>
      “The fiend, the fiend!” He led me to that place.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Bear free and patient thoughts.
      </p>

      <h3>Enter LEAR [fantastically dressed with wild flowers]</h3>

      <p>
        But who comes here?<br>
The safer sense will ne’er accommodate<br>
His master thus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  No, they cannot touch me for coining;<br>
      I am the King himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  O thou side-piercing sight!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper; draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! I’ the clout, i’ the clout! Hewgh! Give the word.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Sweet marjoram.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  I know that voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatter’d me like a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say “ay” and “no” to everything that I said! “Ay” and “no” too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything; ’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  The trick of that voice I do well remember.<br>
      Is ’t not the King?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>          Ay, every inch a king!<br>
      When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br>
      I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?<br>
      Adultery?<br>
      Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery! No:<br>
      The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly<br>
      Does lecher in my sight.<br>
      Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son<br>
      Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br>
      Got ’tween the lawful sheets.<br>
      To ’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br>
      Behold yond simp’ring dame,<br>
      Whose face between her forks presages snow,<br>
      That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br>
      To hear of pleasure’s name,—<br>
      The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to ’t<br>
      With a more riotous appetite.<br>
      Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br>
      Though women all above;<br>
      But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br>
      Beneath is all the fiends’;<br>
      There’s hell, there’s darkness, there’s the sulphurous pit,<br>
      Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!<br>
      Give me an ounce of civet; good apothecary, sweeten my imagination.<br>
      There’s money for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  O, let me kiss that hand!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  O ruin’d piece of nature! This great world<br>
      Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  [Aside.]  I would not take this from report. It is; and my heart breaks at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Read.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  What, with the case of eyes?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how this world goes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  I see it feelingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears; see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places, and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou has seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Ay, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obey’d in office.<br>
      Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br>
      Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back;<br>
      Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind<br>
      For which thou whip’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.<br>
      Through tatter’d clothes great vices do appear;<br>
      Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sins with gold,<br>
      And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;<br>
      Arm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.<br>
      None does offend, none, I say, none; I’ll able ’em.<br>
      Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br>
      To seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,<br>
      And, like a scurvy politician, seem<br>
      To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now.<br>
      Pull off my boots; harder, harder: so.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  O, matter and impertinency mix’d!<br>
      Reason in madness!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.<br>
      I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.<br>
      Thou must be patient; we came crying hither.<br>
      Thou know’st, the first time that we smell the air,<br>
      We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee; mark.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Alack, alack the day!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  When we are born, we cry that we are come<br>
      To this great stage of fools.—This a good block.<br>
      It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe<br>
      A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put ’t in proof;<br>
      And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,<br>
      Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
      </p>

      <h3>Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants]</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him. Sir,<br>
      Your most dear daughter—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even<br>
      The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;<br>
      You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;<br>
      I am cut to the brains.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>        You shall have anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  No seconds? All myself?<br>
      Why, this would make a man a man of salt,<br>
      To use his eyes for garden water-pots,<br>
      [Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>        Good sir,—

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial. Come, come; I am a king,<br>
      My masters, know you that?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  You are a royal one, and we obey you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Then there’s life in ’t. Come, an you get it, you shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.  Exit [running; Attendants follow].
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,<br>
      Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter<br>
      Who redeems Nature from the general curse<br>
      Which twain have brought her to.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Hail, gentle sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>        Sir, speed you: what’s your will?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Most sure and vulgar; every one hears that,<br>
      Which can distinguish sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        But, by your favour,<br>
      How near’s the other army?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Near and on speedy foot; the main descry<br>
      Stands on the hourly thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  I thank you, sir; that’s all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Though that the Queen on special cause is here,<br>
      Her army is mov’d on.  Exit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        I thank you, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;<br>
      Let not my worser spirit tempt me again<br>
      To die before you please!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        Well pray you, father.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Now, good sir, what are you?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows;<br>
      Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,<br>
      Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,<br>
      I’ll lead you to some biding.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Hearty thanks;<br>
      The bounty and the benison of Heaven<br>
      To boot, and boot!
      </p>

      <h3>Enter Steward [OSWALD]</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        A proclaim’d prize! Most happy!<br>
      That eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh<br>
      To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,<br>
      Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out<br>
      That must destroy thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Now let thy friendly hand<br>
      Put strength enough to ’t.  [EDGAR interposes.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        Wherefore, bold peasant,<br>
      Dar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence;<br>
      Lest that the infection of his fortune take<br>
      Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  ’Chill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Let go, slave, or thou diest!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk pass. An ’chud ha’ bin zwagger’d out of my life, ’t would not ha’bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’ old man; keep out, ’che vor ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder. ’Chill be plain with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Out, dunghill!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  ’Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come, no matter vor your foins. [They fight, andEDGAR knocks him down.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.<br>
      If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;<br>
      And give the letters which thou find’st about me<br>
      To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester; seek him out<br>
      Upon the English party. O, untimely death!<br>
      Death!  Dies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  I know thee well; a serviceable villain,<br>
      As duteous to the vices of thy mistress<br>
      As badness would desire.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        What, is he dead?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Sit you down, father; rest you.<br>
      Let’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of<br>
      May be my friends. He’s dead; I am only sorry<br>
      He had no other death’s-man. Let us see.<br>
      Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.<br>
      To know our enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts;<br>
      Their papers, is more lawful.
      </p>

      <p>
        (Reads the letter.) “Let our reciprocal vows be rememb’red. You have many opportunities to cut him off; if your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offer’d. There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror; then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour.

        <blockquote>
          “Your—wife, so I would say—<br>
          “Affectionate servant,<br>
          “GONERIL.”
        </blockquote>

        O indistinguish’d space of woman’s will!<br>
        A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life;<br>
        And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,<br>
        Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified<br>
        Of murderous lechers; and in the mature time<br>
        With this ungracious paper strike the sight<br>
        Of the death-practis’d duke. For him ’tis well<br>
        That of thy death and business I can tell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  The King is mad; how stiff is my vile sense<br>
      That I stand up and have ingenious feeling<br>
      Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract;<br>
      So should my thoughts be sever’d from my griefs,  Drum afar off.<br>
      And woes by wrong imaginations lose<br>
      The knowledge of themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Give me your hand.<br>
      Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum.<br>
      Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.  Exeunt.
