      <h2>‘How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix’ [16—]</h2>

      <p>
        I SPRANG to the stirrup, and Joris, and he; <br>
        I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;<br>
        ‘Good speed!’ cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew;<br>
        ‘Speed!’ echoed the wall to us galloping through;<br>
        Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,<br>
        And into the midnight we galloped abreast.<br>
         Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace<br>
        Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;<br>
        I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<br>
        Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,<br>
        Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,<br>
        Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near<br>
        Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;<br>
        At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;<br>
        At Düffeld, ’twas morning as plain as could be;<br>
        And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,<br>
        So Joris broke silence with ‘Yet there is time!’
      </p>

      <p>
        At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,<br>
        And against him the cattle stood black every one,<br>
        To stare through the mist at us galloping past,<br>
        And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,<br>
        With resolute shoulders, each butting away<br>
        The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.
      </p>

      <p>
        And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br>
        For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;<br>
        And one eye’s black intelligence,—ever that glance<br>
        O’er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!<br>
        And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon<br>
        His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.
      </p>

      <p>
        By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, ‘Stay spur!<br>
        Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault’s not in her,<br>
        We’ll remember at Aix’—for one heard the quick wheeze<br>
        Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,<br>
        And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,<br>
        As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we were left galloping, Joris and I,<br>
        Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br>
        The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,<br>
        ’Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;<br>
        Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,<br>
        And ‘Gallop,’ gasped Joris, ‘for Aix is in sight!’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘How they’ll greet us!’—and all in a moment his roan<br>
        Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;<br>
        And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br>
        Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br>
        With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,<br>
        And with circles of red for his eye-sockets’ rim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,<br>
        Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,<br>
        Stood up in the stirrup, learned, patted his ear,<br>
        Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;<br>
        Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,<br>
        Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all I remember is, friends flocking round<br>
        As I sat with his head ’twixt my knees on the ground;<br>
        And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,<br>
        As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br>
        Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)<br>
        Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.
      </p>

      <h2>The Lost Leader</h2>

      <p>
        JUST for a handful of silver he left us,<br>
          Just for a riband to stick in his coat—<br>
        Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us,<br>
          Lost all the others she lets us devote;<br>
        They, with the gold to give, doled him out silver,<br>
          So much was theirs who so little allowed:<br>
        How all our copper had gone for his service!<br>
          Rags—were they purple, his heart had been proud!<br>
        We that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him,<br>
          Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,<br>
        Learned his great language, caught his clear accents,<br>
          Made him our pattern to live and to die!<br>
        Shakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,<br>
          Burns, Shelley, were with us,—they watch from their graves!<br>
        He alone breaks from the van and the freemen,<br>
          He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves!
      </p>

      <p>
        We shall march prospering,—not through his presence;<br>
          Songs may inspirit us,—not from his lyre;<br>
        Deeds will be done,—while he boasts his quiescence,<br>
          Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire:<br>
        Blot out his name, then, record one lost soul more,<br>
          One task more declined, one more footpath untrod,<br>
        One more triumph for devils and sorrow for angels,<br>
          One wrong more to man, one more insult to God!<br>
        Life’s night begins: let him never come back to us!<br>
          There would be doubt, hesitation and pain,<br>
        Forced praise on our part—the glimmer of twilight,<br>
          Never glad confident morning again!<br>
        Best fight on well, for we taught him,—strike gallantly,<br>
          Menace our heart ere we master his own;<br>
        Then let him receive the new knowledge and wait us,<br>
          Pardoned in Heaven, the first by the throne!
