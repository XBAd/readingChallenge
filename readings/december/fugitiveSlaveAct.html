          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850" target="_blank">The Fugitive Slave Act</a>
           or Fugitive Slave Law was passed by the
          United States Congress on September 18, 1850, as part of the
          Compromise of 1850 between Southern slave-holding interests
          and Northern Free-Soilers. The Act was one of the most controversial
          elements of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a
          "slave power conspiracy". It required that all escaped slaves, upon
          capture, be returned to their masters and that officials and
          citizens of free states had to cooperate. Abolitionists nicknamed
          it the "Bloodhound Law", for the dogs that were used to track
          down runaway slaves.

        [The Fugitive Slave Act was part of the group of measures known collectively as the “Compromise of 1850.” By this compromise, the antislavery party gained the admission of California as a free state; and the prohibition of slave-trading in the District of Columbia. The slavery party, on the other hand, besides concessions with regard to Texas, gained this act, which, however, by its stringency did much to rouse abolitionist sentiment in the North.]

In no trial or hearing under this act shall the testimony of such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence; and the certificates in this and the first [fourth] section mentioned, shall be conclusive of the right of the persons or persons in whose favor granted, to remove such fugitive to the State or Territory from which he escaped, and shall prevent all molestation of such person or persons by any process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person whomsoever.

Whereupon the court shall cause a record to be made of the matters so proved, and also a general description of the person so escaping, with such convenient certainty as may be; and a transcript of such record, authenticated by the <span class="tooltip">attestation<span class="tooltiptext">a proving of the existence of something through evidence; an official verification of something as true or authentic</span></span> of the clerk and of the seal of the said court, being produced in any other State, Territory, or district in which the person so escaping may be found, and being exhibited to any judge, commissioner, or other officer authorized by the law of the United States to cause persons escaping from service or labor to be delivered up, shall be held and taken to be full and conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the service or labor of the person escaping is due to the party in such record mentioned. And upon the production by the said party of other and further evidence if necessary, either oral or by affidavit, in addition to what is contained in the said record of the identity of the person escaping, he or she shall be delivered up to the claimant. And the said court, commissioner, judge, or other person authorized by this act to grant certificates to claimants or fugitives, shall, upon the production of the record and other evidences aforesaid, grant to such claimant a certificate of his right to take any such person identified and proved to be owing service or labor as aforesaid, which certificate shall authorized such claimant to seize or arrest and transport such person to the State or Territory from which he escaped: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring the production of a transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid. But in its absence the claim shall be heard and determined upon other satisfactory proofs, competent in law.
