        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Agonistes" target="_blank">Samson Agonistes</a>
           (from Greek Σαμσών ἀγωνιστής, "Samson the champion") is a tragic
           closet drama by John Milton. It appeared with the publication of
           Milton's <em>Paradise Regain'd</em> in 1671. <em>Samson Agonistes</em> draws
           on the story of Samson from the Old Testament, Judges 13–16; in fact
           it is a dramatisation of the story starting at Judges 16:23. The drama
           starts in medias res (opens in the midst of the plot). Samson has been captured by the Philistines,
           had his hair, the container of his strength, cut off and his eyes cut out.
           Samson is "Blind among enemies, O worse than chains" (line 66).
           On the title page, Milton wrote that the piece was a "Dramatic Poem"
           instead of it being a drama. He did not wish for it to be performed
           on stage, but thought that the text could still influence people.
           He hoped that in combining Samson with traits of other Biblical figures,
           including those of Job or of the Psalmist, he could come up with the
           perfect hero who could deal with complex theological issues.

        <em>Har.</em> Into the common prison, there to grind <br>
  Among the slaves and asses, thy comrades,<br>
  As good for nothing else, no better service<br>
  With those thy boisterous locks; no worthy match<br>
  For valour to assail, nor by the sword<br>
  Of noble warrior, so to stain his honour,<br>
  But by the barber’s razor best subdued.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> All these indignities, for such they are<br>
      From thine, these evils I deserve and more,<br>
      Acknowledge them from God inflicted on me<br>
      Justly, yet despair not of his final pardon,<br>
      Whose ear is ever open, and his eye<br>
      Gracious to re-admit the <span class="tooltip">suppliant<span class="tooltiptext">a person making a humble plea to someone in power or authority.</span></span>;<br>
      In confidence whereof I once again<br>
      Defy thee to the trial of mortal fight,<br>
      By combat to decide whose god is God,<br>
      Thine, or whom I with Israel’s sons adore.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Har.</em> Fair honour that thou dost thy God, in trusting<br>
      He will accept thee to defend his cause,<br>
      A murtherer, a revolter, and a robber!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> <span class="tooltip">Tongue-doughty<span class="tooltiptext">Valiant in speech; bragging.</span></span> giant, how dost thou prove me these?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Har.</em> Is not thy nation subject to our Lords?<br>
      Their magistrates confessed it when they took thee<br>
      As a league-breaker, and delivered bound<br>
      Into our hands; for hadst thou not committed<br>
      Notorious murder on those thirty men<br>
      At <span class="tooltip">Ascalon<span class="tooltiptext">An ancient city of southwest Palestine on the Mediterranean Sea. Inhabited as early as the third millennium bc, it was a seat of worship for the goddess Astarte.</span></span>, who never did thee harm,<br>
      Then, like a robber, stripp’dst them of their robes?<br>
      The Philistines, when thou hadst broke the league,<br>
      Went up with armed powers thee only seeking,<br>
      To others did no violence nor spoil.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Among the daughters of the Philistines<br>
      I chose a wife, which argued me no foe,<br>
      And in your city held my nuptial feast;<br>
      But your ill-meaning politician lords,<br>
      Under pretence of bridal friends and guests,<br>
      Appointed to await me thirty spies,<br>
      Who, threatening cruel death, constrained the bride<br>
      To wring from me, and tell to them, my secret,<br>
      That solved the riddle which I had proposed.<br>
      When I perceived all set on <span class="tooltip">enmity<span class="tooltiptext">the state or feeling of being actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.</span></span>,<br>
      As on my enemies, wherever chanced,<br>
      I used hostility, and took their spoil,<br>
      To pay my underminers in their coin.<br>
      My nation was subjected to your lords!<br>
      It was the force of conquest; force with force<br>
      Is well ejected when the conquered can.<br>
      But I, a private person, whom my country<br>
      As a league-breaker gave up bound, presumed<br>
      Single rebellion, and did hostile acts!<br>
      I was no private, but a person raised,<br>
      With strength sufficient, and command from Heaven,<br>
      To free my country. If their servile minds<br>
      Me, their Deliverer sent, would not receive,<br>
      But to their masters gave me up for nought,<br>
      The unworthier they; whence to this day they serve.<br>
      I was to do my part from Heaven assigned,<br>
      And had performed it if my known offence<br>
      Had not disabled me, not all your force.<br>
      These shifts refuted, answer thy appellant,<br>
      Though by his blindness maimed for high attempts,<br>
      Who now defies thee thrice to single fight,<br>
      As a petty enterprise of small enforce.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Har.</em> With thee, a man condemned, a slave enrolled,<br>
      Due by the law to capital punishment?<br>
      To fight with thee no man of arms will deign.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Cam’st thou for this, vain boaster, to survey me,<br>
      To <span class="tooltip">descant<span class="tooltiptext">talk tediously or at length.</span></span> on my strength, and give thy verdict?<br>
      Come nearer; part not hence so slight informed;<br>
      But take good heed my hand survey not thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Har.</em> O <span class="tooltip">Baal-zebub<span class="tooltiptext">In the Old Testament, the Hebrew Baal-zebub, meaning the lord of the flies, or possibly, as some translations have it, the lord of dung, was the Philistine pagan god of Ekron. In the New Testament, the Greek form of Baal-zebub is Beelzebub, or Beelzebul, a name used by Jesus Christ in reference to Satan.</span></span>! can my ears unused<br>
      Hear these dishonours, and not render death?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> No man withholds thee; nothing from thy hand<br>
      Fear I incurable; bring up thy van;<br>
      My heels are fettered, but my fist is free.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Har.</em> This insolence other kind of answer fits.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Go, baffled coward, lest I run upon thee,<br>
      Though in these chains, bulk without spirit vast,<br>
      And with one buffet lay thy structure low,<br>
      Or swing thee in the air, then dash thee down,<br>
      To the hazard of thy brains and shattered sides.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Har.</em> By <span class="tooltip">Astaroth<span class="tooltiptext">Astaroth (also Ashtaroth, Astarot and Asteroth), in demonology, is the Great Duke of Hell in the first hierarchy with Beelzebub and Lucifer; he is part of the evil trinity. He is a male figure most likely named after the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar.</span></span>, ere long thou shalt lament<br>
      These braveries, in irons loaden on thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> His Giantship is gone somewhat crest-fallen,<br>
      Stalking with less unconscionable strides,<br>
      And lower looks, but in a sultry chafe.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> I dread him not, nor all his giant brood,<br>
      Though fame divulge him father of five sons,<br>
      All of gigantic size, Goliah chief.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> He will directly to the lords, I fear,<br>
      And with malicious counsel stir them up<br>
      Some way or other yet further to afflict thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> He must allege some cause, and offered fight<br>
      Will not dare mention, lest a question rise<br>
      Whether he durst accept the offer or not;<br>
      And that he durst not plain enough appeared.<br>
      Much more affliction than already felt<br>
      They cannot well impose, nor I sustain,<br>
      If they intend advantage of my labours,<br>
      The work of many hands, which earns my keeping,<br>
      With no small profit daily to my owners.<br>
      But come what will; my deadliest foe will prove<br>
      My speediest friend, by death to rid me hence;<br>
      The worst that he can give to me the best.<br>
      Yet so it may fall out, because their end<br>
      Is hate, not help to me, it may with mine<br>
      Draw their own ruin who attempt the deed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> O, how comely it is, and how reviving<br>
      To the spirits of just men long oppressed,<br>
      When God into the hands of their deliverer<br>
      Puts invincible might,<br>
      To quell the mighty of the earth, the oppressor,<br>
      The brute and boisterous force of violent men,<br>
      Hardy and industrious to support<br>
      Tyrannic power, but raging to pursue<br>
      The righteous, and all such as honour truth!<br>
      He all their ammunition<br>
      And feats of war defeats,<br>
      With plain heroic magnitude of mind<br>
      And celestial vigour armed;<br>
      Their armouries and magazins contemns,<br>
      Renders them useless, while<br>
      With wingèd expedition<br>
      Swift as the lightning glance he executes<br>
      His errand on the wicked, who, surprised,<br>
      Lose their defence, distracted and amazed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But patience is more oft the exercise<br>
      Of saints, the trial of their fortitude,<br>
      Making them each his own deliverer,<br>
      And victor over all<br>
      That tyranny or fortune can inflict.<br>
      Either of these is in thy lot,<br>
      Samson, with might endued<br>
      Above the sons of men; but sight bereaved<br>
      May chance to number thee with those<br>
      Whom Patience finally must crown.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Idol’s day hath been to thee no day of rest,<br>
      Labouring thy mind<br>
      More than the working day thy hands.<br>
      And yet, perhaps, more trouble is behind;<br>
      For I descry this way<br>
      Some other tending; in his hand<br>
      A sceptre or quaint staff he bears,<br>
      Comes on amain, speed in his look.<br>
      By his habit I discern him now<br>
      A public officer, and now at hand.<br>
      His message will be short and <span class="tooltip">voluble<span class="tooltiptext">characterized by ready or rapid speech</span></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> Ebrews, the prisoner Samson here I seek.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> His manacles remark him; there he sits.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> Samson, to thee our Lords thus bid me say:<br>
      This day to Dagon is a solemn feast,<br>
      With sacrifices, triumph, pomp, and games;<br>
      Thy strength they know surpassing human rate,<br>
      And now some public proof thereof require<br>
      To honour this great feast, and great assembly.<br>
      Rise, therefore, with all speed, and come along,<br>
      Where I will see thee heartened and fresh clad,<br>
      To appear as fits before the illustrious Lords.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Thou know’st I am an Ebrew; therefore tell<br>
      Our law forbids at their religious rites<br>
      My presence; for that cause I cannot come.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> This answer, be assured, will not content them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Have they not sword-players, and every sort<br>
      Of gymnic artists, wrestlers, riders, runners,<br>
      Jugglers and dancers, antics, mummers, mimics,<br>
      But they must pick me out, with shackles tired,<br>
      And over-laboured at their public mill,<br>
      To make them sport with blind activity?<br>
      Do they not seek occasion of new quarrels,<br>
      On my refusal, to distress me more,<br>
      Or make a game of my calamities?<br>
      Return the way thou cam’st; I will not come.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> Regard thyself; this will offend them highly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Myself! my conscience, and internal peace.<br>
      Can they think me so broken, so debased<br>
      With corporal servitude, that my mind ever<br>
      Will condescend to such absurd commands?<br>
      Although their drudge, to be their fool or jester,<br>
      And, in my midst of sorrow and heart-grief,<br>
      To shew them feats, and play before their god—<br>
      The worst of all indignities, yet on me<br>
      Joined with extreme contempt! I will not come.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> My message was imposed on me with speed,<br>
      Brooks no delay: is this thy resolution?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> So take it with what speed thy message needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> I am sorry what this stoutness will produce.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Perhaps thou shalt have cause to sorrow indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Consider, Samson; matters now are strained<br>
      Up to the highth, whether to hold or break.<br>
      He’s gone and who knows how he may report<br>
      Thy words by adding fuel to the flame?<br>
      Expect another message, more imperious,<br>
      More lordly thundering than thou well wilt bear.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Shall I abuse this consecrated gift<br>
      Of strength, again returning with my hair<br>
      After my great transgression—so requite<br>
      Favour renewed, and add a greater sin<br>
      By prostituting holy things to idols,<br>
      A Nazarite, in place abominable,<br>
      Vaunting my strength in honour to their Dagon?<br>
      Besides how vile, contemptible, ridiculous,<br>
      What act more execrably unclean, profane?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Yet with this strength thou serv’st the Philistines,<br>
      Idolatrous, uncircumcised, unclean.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Not in their idol-worship, but by labour<br>
      Honest and lawful to deserve my food<br>
      Of those who have me in their civil power.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Where the heart joins not, outward acts defile not.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Where outward force constrains, the sentence holds:<br>
      But who constrains me to the temple of Dagon,<br>
      Not dragging? The Philistian Lords command:<br>
      Commands are no constraints. If I obey them,<br>
      I do it freely, venturing to displease<br>
      God for the fear of Man, and Man prefer,<br>
      Set God behind; which, in his jealousy,<br>
      Shall never, unrepented, find forgiveness.<br>
      Yet that he may dispense with me, or thee,<br>
      Present in temples at idolatrous rites<br>
      For some important cause, thou need’st not doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> How thou wilt here come off surmounts my reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Be of good courage; I begin to feel<br>
      Some rousing motions in me, which dispose<br>
      To something extraordinary in my thoughts.<br>
      I with this messenger will go along—<br>
      Nothing to do, be sure, that may dishonour<br>
      Our Law, or stain my vow of Nazarite.<br>
      If there be aught of presage in the mind,<br>
      This day will be remarkable in my life<br>
      By some great act, or of my days the last.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> In time thou hast resolved: the man returns.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> Samson, this second message from our Lords<br>
      To thee I am bid say: Art thou our slave,<br>
      Our captive, at the public mill our drudge,<br>
      And dar’st thou, at our sending and command,<br>
      Dispute thy coming? Come without delay;<br>
      Or we shall find such engines to assail<br>
      And hamper thee, as thou shalt come of force,<br>
      Though thou wert firmlier fastened than a rock.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> I could be well content to try their art,<br>
      Which to no few of them would prove pernicious;<br>
      Yet, knowing their advantages too many,<br>
      Because they shall not trail me through their streets<br>
      Like a wild beast, I am content to go.<br>
      Masters’ commands come with a power resistless<br>
      To such as owe them absolute subjection;<br>
      And for a life who will not change his purpose?<br>
      (So mutable are all the ways of men!)<br>
      Yet this be sure, in nothing to comply<br>
      Scandalous or forbidden in our Law.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Off.</em> I praise thy resolution. Doff these links:<br>
      By this compliance thou wilt win the Lords<br>
      To favour, and perhaps to set thee free.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sams.</em> Brethren, farewell. Your company along<br>
      I will not wish, lest it perhaps offend them<br>
      To see me girt with friends; and how the sight<br>
      Of me, as of a common enemy,<br>
      So dreaded once, may now exasperate them<br>
      I know not. Lords are lordliest in their wine;<br>
      And the well-feasted priest then soonest fired<br>
      With zeal, if aught religion seem concerned;<br>
      No less the people, on their holy days,<br>
      Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable.<br>
      Happen what may, of me expect to hear<br>
      Nothing dishonourable, impure, unworthy<br>
      Our God, our Law, my nation, or myself;<br>
      The last of me or no I cannot warrant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Go, and the Holy One<br>
      Of Israel be thy guide<br>
      To what may serve his glory best, and spread his name<br>
      Great among the Heathen round;<br>
      Send thee the Angel of thy birth, to stand<br>
      Fast by thy side, who from thy father’s field<br>
      Rode up in flames after his message told<br>
      Of thy conception, and be now a shield<br>
      Of fire; that Spirit that first rushed on thee<br>
      In the camp of Dan,<br>
      Be efficacious in thee now at need!<br>
      For never was from Heaven imparted<br>
      Measure of strength so great to mortal seed,<br>
      As in thy wondrous actions hath been seen.<br>
      But wherefore comes old Manoa in such haste<br>
      With youthful steps? Much livelier than erewhile<br>
      He seems: supposing here to find his son,<br>
      Or of him bringing to us some glad news?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Peace with you, brethren! My inducement hither<br>
      Was not at present here to find my son,<br>
      By order of the Lords new parted hence<br>
      To come and play before them at their feast.<br>
      I heard all as I came; the city rings,<br>
      And numbers thither flock: I had no will,<br>
      Lest I should see him forced to things unseemly.<br>
      But that which moved my coming now was chiefly<br>
      To give ye part with me what hope I have<br>
      With good success to work his liberty.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> That hope would much rejoice us to partake<br>
      With thee. Say, reverend sire; we thirst to hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> I have attempted, one by one, the Lords,<br>
      Either at home, or through the high street passing,<br>
      With supplication prone and father’s tears,<br>
      To accept of ransom for my son, their prisoner.<br>
      Some much averse I found, and wondrous harsh,<br>
      Contemptuous, proud, set on revenge and spite;<br>
      That part most reverenced Dagon and his priests:<br>
      Others more moderate seeming, but their aim<br>
      Private reward, for which both God and State<br>
      They easily would set to sale: a third<br>
      More generous far and civil, who confessed<br>
      They had enough revenged, having reduced<br>
      Their foe to misery beneath their fears;<br>
      The rest was <span class="tooltip">magnanimity<span class="tooltiptext">the fact or condition of being magnanimous; generosity.</span></span> to remit,<br>
      If some convenient ransom were proposed.<br>
      What noise or shout was that? It tore the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Doubtless the people shouting to behold<br>
      Their once great dread, captive and blind before them,<br>
      Or at some proof of strength before them shown.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> His ransom, if my whole inheritance<br>
      May compass it, shall willingly be paid<br>
      And numbered down. Much rather I shall choose<br>
      To live the poorest in my tribe, than richest<br>
      And he in that calamitous prison left.<br>
      No, I am fixed not to part hence without him.<br>
      For his redemption all my <span class="tooltip">patrimony<span class="tooltiptext">an estate inherited from one's father or ancestor</span></span>,<br>
      If need be, I am ready to forgo<br>
      And quit. Not wanting him, I shall want nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Fathers are wont to lay up for their sons;<br>
      Thou for thy son art bent to lay out all:<br>
      Sons wont to nurse their parents in old age;<br>
      Thou in old age car’st how to nurse thy son,<br>
      Made older than thy age through eye-sight lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> It shall be my delight to tend his eyes,<br>
      And view him sitting in his house, ennobled<br>
      With all those high exploits by him achieved,<br>
      And on his shoulders waving down those locks<br>
      That of a nation armed the strength contained.<br>
      And I persuade me God hath not permitted<br>
      His strength again to grow up with his hair<br>
      Garrisoned round about him like a camp<br>
      Of faithful soldiery, were not his purpose<br>
      To use him further yet in some great service—<br>
      Not to sit idle with so great a gift<br>
      Useless, and thence ridiculous, about him.<br>
      And, since his strength with eye-sight was not lost,<br>
      God will restore him eye-sight to his strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Thy hopes are not ill founded, nor seem vain,<br>
      Of his delivery, and thy joy thereon<br>
      Conceived, agreeable to a father’s love;<br>
      In both which we, as next, participate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> I know your friendly minds, and .. O, what noise!<br>
      Mercy of Heaven! what hideous noise was that?<br>
      Horribly loud, unlike the former shout.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Noise call you it, or universal groan,<br>
      As if the whole inhabitation perished?<br>
      Blood, death, and deathful deeds, are in that noise,<br>
      Ruin, destruction at the utmost point.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Of ruin indeed methought I heard the noise.<br>
      Oh! it continues; they have slain my son.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Thy son is rather slaying them: that outcry<br>
      From slaughter of one foe could not ascend.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Some dismal accident it needs must be.<br>
      What shall we do—stay here, or run and see?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Best keep together here, lest, running thither,<br>
      We unawares, run into danger’s mouth.<br>
      This evil on the Philistines is fallen:<br>
      From whom could else a general cry be heard?<br>
      The sufferers, then, will scarce molest us here;<br>
      From other hands we need not much to fear.<br>
      What if, his eye-sight (for to Israel’s God<br>
      Nothing is hard) by miracle restored,<br>
      He now be dealing dole among his foes,<br>
      And over heaps of slaughtered walk his way?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> That were a joy presumptuous to be thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Yet God hath wrought things as incredible<br>
      For his people of old; what hinders now?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> He can, I know, but doubt to think he will;<br>
      Yet hope would fain subscribe, and tempts belief.<br>
      A little stay will bring some notice hither.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> Of good or bad so great, of bad the sooner;<br>
      For evil news rides post, while good news baits.<br>
      And to our wish I see one hither speeding—<br>
      An Ebrew, as I guess, and of our tribe.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Messenger.</em> O, whither shall I run, or which way fly<br>
      The sight of this so horrid spectacle,<br>
      Which erst my eyes beheld, and yet behold?<br>
      For dire imagination still, pursues me.<br>
      But providence or instinct of nature seems,<br>
      Or reason, though disturbed and scarce consulted,<br>
      To have guided me aright, I know not how,<br>
      To thee first, reverend Manoa, and to these<br>
      My countrymen, whom here I knew remaining,<br>
      As at some distance from the place of horror,<br>
      So in the sad event too much concerned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> The accident was loud, and here before thee<br>
      With rueful cry; yet what it was we hear not.<br>
      No preface needs; thou seest we long to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> It would burst forth; but I recover breath,<br>
      And sense distract, to know well what I utter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Tell us the sum; the circumstance defer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> Gaza yet stands; but all her sons are fallen,<br>
      All in a moment overwhelmed and fallen.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Sad! but thou know’st to Israelites not saddest<br>
      The desolation of a hostile city.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> Feed on that first; there may in grief be <span class="tooltip">surfeit<span class="tooltiptext">an excessive amount of something.</span></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Relate to whom.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em>    By Samson.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>        That still lessens<br>
      The sorrow, and converts it nigh to joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> Ah! Manoa, I refrain too suddenly<br>
      To utter what will come at last too soon,<br>
      Lest evil tidings, with too rude irruption<br>
      Hitting thy aged ear, should pierce too deep.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Suspense in news is torture; speak them out.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> Then take the worst in brief: Samson is dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> The worst indeed! O, all my hope’s defeated<br>
      To free him hence! but Death, who sets all free,<br>
      Hath paid his ransom now and full discharge.<br>
      What windy joy this day had I conceived,<br>
      Hopeful of his delivery, which now proves<br>
      Abortive as the first-born bloom of spring<br>
      Nipt with the lagging rear of winter’s frost!<br>
      Yet, ere I give the reins to grief, say first<br>
      How died he; death to life is crown or shame.<br>
      All by him fell, thou say’st; by whom fell he?<br>
      What glorious hand gave Samson his death’s wound?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> Unwounded of his enemies he fell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Wearied with slaughter, then, or how? explain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> By his own hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>    Self-violence! What cause<br>
      Brought him so soon at variance with himself<br>
      Among his foes?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em>    Inevitable cause—<br>
      At once both to destroy and be destroyed.<br>
      The edifice, where all were met to see him,<br>
      Upon their heads and on his own he pulled.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> O lastly over-strong against thyself!<br>
      A dreadful way thou took’st to thy revenge.<br>
      More than enough we know; but, while things yet<br>
      Are in confusion, give us, if thou canst,<br>
      Eye-witness of what first or last was done,<br>
      Relation more particular and distinct.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mess.</em> Occasions drew me early to this city;<br>
      And, as the gates I entered with sun-rise,<br>
      The morning trumpets festival proclaimed<br>
      Through each high street. Little I had dispatched,<br>
      When all abroad was rumoured that this day<br>
      Samson should be brought forth, to shew the people<br>
      Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games.<br>
      I sorrowed at his captive state, but minded<br>
      Not to be absent at that spectacle.<br>
      The building was a spacious theatre,<br>
      Half round on two main pillars vaulted high,<br>
      With seats where all the Lords, and each degree<br>
      Of sort, might sit in order to behold;<br>
      The other side was open, where the throng<br>
      On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand:<br>
      I among these aloof obscurely stood.<br>
      The feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice<br>
      Had filled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,<br>
      When to their sports they turned. Immediately<br>
      Was Samson as a public servant brought,<br>
      In their state livery clad: before him pipes<br>
      And timbrels; on each side went armed guards;<br>
      Both horse and foot before him and behind,<br>
      Archers and slingers, <span class="tooltip">cataphracts<span class="tooltiptext">a suit of armor for the whole body</span></span>, and spears.<br>
      At sight of him the people with a shout<br>
      Rifted the air, clamouring their god with praise,<br>
      Who had made their dreadful enemy, their thrall.<br>
      He patient, but undaunted, where they led him,<br>
      Came to the place; and what was set before him,<br>
      Which without help of eye might be assayed,<br>
      To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed<br>
      All with incredible, stupendious force,<br>
      None daring to appear antagonist.<br>
      At length, for intermission sake, they led him<br>
      Between the pillars; he his guide requested<br>
      (For so from such as nearer stood we heard),<br>
      As over-tired, to let him lean a while<br>
      With both his arms on those two massy pillars,<br>
      That to the arched roof gave main support.<br>
      He unsuspicious led him; which when Samson<br>
      Felt in his arms, with head a while enclined,<br>
      And eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,<br>
      Or some great matter in his mind revolved:<br>
      At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud:—<br>
      “Hitherto, Lords, what your commands imposed<br>
      I have performed, as reason was, obeying,<br>
      Not without wonder or delight beheld;<br>
      Now, of my own accord, such other trial<br>
      I mean to shew you of my strength yet greater<br>
      As with amaze shall strike all who behold.”<br>
      This uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed;<br>
      As with the force of winds and waters pent<br>
      When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars<br>
      With horrible convulsion to and fro<br>
      He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew<br>
      The whole roof after them with burst of thunder<br>
      Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,<br>
      Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,<br>
      Their choice nobility and flower, not only<br>
      Of this, but each Philistian city round,<br>
      Met from all parts to solemnize this feast.<br>
      Samson, with these immixed, inevitably<br>
      Pulled down the same destruction on himself;<br>
      The vulgar only scaped, who stood without.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> O dearly bought revenge, yet glorious!<br>
      Living or dying thou has fulfilled<br>
      The work for which thou wast foretold<br>
      To Israel, and now liest victorious<br>
      Among thy slain self-killed;<br>
      Not willingly, but tangled in the fold<br>
      Of dire Necessity, whose law in death conjoined<br>
      Thee with thy slaughtered foes, in number more<br>
      Than all thy life had slain before.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Semichor.</em> While their hearts were <span class="tooltip">jocund<span class="tooltiptext">cheerful and lighthearted.</span></span> and sublime,<br>
      Drunk with idolatry, drunk with wine<br>
      And fat regorged of bulls and goats,<br>
      Chaunting their idol, and preferring<br>
      Before our Living Dread, who dwells<br>
      In Silo, his bright sanctuary,<br>
      Among them he a spirit of phrenzy sent,<br>
      Who hurt their minds,<br>
      And urged them on with mad desire<br>
      To call in haste for their destroyer.<br>
      They, only set on sport and play,<br>
      Unweetingly importuned<br>
      Their own destruction to come speedy upon them.<br>
      So fond are mortal men,<br>
      Fallen into wrath divine,<br>
      As their own ruin on themselves to invite,<br>
      Insensate left, or to sense <span class="tooltip">reprobate<span class="tooltiptext">an unprincipled or depraved person</span></span>,<br>
      And with blindness internal struck.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Semichor.</em> But he, though blind of sight,<br>
      Despised, and thought extinguished quite,<br>
      With inward eyes illuminated,<br>
      His fiery virtue roused<br>
      From under ashes into sudden flame,<br>
      And as an evening Dragon came,<br>
      Assailant on the perched roosts<br>
      And nests in order ranged<br>
      Of tame villatic fowl, but as an Eagle<br>
      His cloudless thunder bolted on their heads.<br>
      So Virtue, given for lost,<br>
      Depressed and overthrown, as seemed,<br>
      Like that self-begotten bird<br>
      In the Arabian woods embost,<br>
      That no second knows nor third,<br>
      And lay erewhile a holocaust,<br>
      From out her ashy womb now teemed,<br>
      Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most<br>
      When most unactive deemed;<br>
      And, though her body die, her fame survives,<br>
      A secular bird, ages of lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em> Come, come; no time for lamentation now,<br>
      Nor much more cause. Samson hath quit himself<br>
      Like Samson, and heroicly hath finished<br>
      A life heroic, on his enemies<br>
      Fully revenged—hath left them years of mourning,<br>
      And lamentation to the sons of Caphtor<br>
      Through all Philistian bounds; to Israel<br>
      Honour hath left and freedom, let but them<br>
      Find courage to lay hold on this occasion;<br>
      To himself and father’s house eternal fame;<br>
      And, which is best and happiest yet, all this<br>
      With God not parted from him, as was feared,<br>
      But favouring and assisting to the end.<br>
      Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail<br>
      Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,<br>
      Dispraise, or blame; nothing but well and fair,<br>
      And what may quiet us in a death so noble.<br>
      Let us go find the body where it lies<br>
      Soaked in his enemies’ blood, and from the stream<br>
      With lavers pure, and cleansing herbs, wash off<br>
      The clotted gore. I, with what speed the while<br>
      (Gaza is not in plight to say us nay),<br>
      Will send for all my kindred, all my friends,<br>
      To fetch him hence, and solemnly attend,<br>
      With silent <span class="tooltip">obsequy<span class="tooltiptext">a funeral or burial rite</span></span> and funeral train,<br>
      Home to his father’s house. There will I build him<br>
      A monument, and plant it round with shade<br>
      Of laurel ever green and branching palm,<br>
      With all his trophies hung, and acts enrolled<br>
      In copious legend, or sweet lyric song.<br>
      Thither shall all the valiant youth resort,<br>
      And from his memory inflame their breasts<br>
      To matchless valour and adventures high;<br>
      The virgins also shall, on feastful days,<br>
      Visit his tomb with flowers, only bewailing<br>
      His lot unfortunate in nuptial choice,<br>
      From whence captivity and loss of eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Chor.</em> All is best, though we oft doubt<br>
      What the unsearchable dispose<br>
      Of Highest Wisdom brings about,<br>
      And ever best found in the close.<br>
      Oft He seems to hide his face,<br>
      But unexpectedly returns,<br>
      And to his faithful Champion hath in place<br>
      Bore witness gloriously; whence Gaza mourns,<br>
      And all that band them to resist<br>
      His uncontrollable intent.
