          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti" target="_blank">Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti</a>
           (12 May 1828 – 9 April 1882), generally known as Dante Gabriel Rossetti
           was an English poet, illustrator, painter and translator, and a member
           of the Rossetti family. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in
           1848 with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. Rossetti was
           later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists
           and writers influenced by the movement, most notably William Morris
           and Edward Burne-Jones. His work also influenced the European Symbolists
           and was a major precursor of the Aesthetic movement. Rossetti's art was
           characterised by its sensuality and its medieval revivalism. His early
           poetry was influenced by John Keats. His later poetry was characterised
           by the complex interlinking of thought and feeling, especially in his
           sonnet sequence, <em>The House of Life</em>. Poetry and image are closely
           entwined in Rossetti's work. He frequently wrote sonnets to accompany
           his pictures, spanning from <em>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin</em> (1849)
           and <em>Astarte Syriaca</em> (1877), while also creating art to illustrate
           poems such as <em>Goblin Market</em> by the celebrated poet Christina Rossetti,
           his sister. Rossetti's personal life was closely linked to his work,
           especially his relationships with his models and muses Elizabeth
           Siddal (whom he married), Fanny Cornforth and Jane Morris.

      <h2>Song</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN I am dead, my dearest, <br>
          Sing no sad songs for me;<br>
        Plant thou no roses at my head,<br>
          Nor shady cypress tree:<br>
        Be the green grass above me<br>
          With showers and dewdrops wet;<br>
        And if thou wilt, remember,<br>
          And if thou wilt, forget.
      </p>

      <p>
        I shall not see the shadows,<br>
          I shall not feel the rain;<br>
        I shall not hear the nightingale<br>
          Sing on, as if in pain;<br>
        And dreaming through the twilight<br>
          That doth not rise nor set,<br>
        Haply I may remember,<br>
          And haply may forget.
      </p>

      <h2>Remember</h2>

      <p>
        REMEMBER me when I am gone away,<br>
          Gone far away into the silent land;<br>
          When you can no more hold me by the hand,<br>
        Nor I half turn to go, yet turning stay.<br>
        Remember me when no more day by day<br>
          You tell me of our future that you plann’d:<br>
          Only remember me; you understand<br>
        It will be late to counsel then or pray.<br>
        Yet if you should forget me for a while<br>
          And afterwards remember, do not grieve:<br>
          For if the darkness and corruption leave<br>
          A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,<br>
        Better by far you should forget and smile<br>
          Than that you should remember and be sad.
      </p>

      <h2>Up-Hill</h2>

      <p>
        DOES the road wind up-hill all the way?<br>
          Yes, to the very end.<br>
        Will the day’s journey take the whole long day?<br>
          From morn to night, my friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        But is there for the night a resting-place?<br>
          A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.<br>
        May not the darkness hide it from my face?<br>
          You cannot miss that inn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?<br>
          Those who have gone before.<br>
        Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?<br>
          They will not keep you standing at that door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?<br>
          Of labour you shall find the sum.<br>
        Will there be beds for me and all who seek?<br>
          Yea, beds for all who come.
      </p>

      <h2>In the Round Tower at Jhansi</h2>

      <h2>June 8, 1857 (Indian Mutiny)</h2>

      <p>
        A HUNDRED, a thousand to one: even so;<br>
          Not a hope in the world remained:<br>
        The swarming howling wretches below<br>
          Gained and gained and gained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skene looked at his pale young wife.<br>
          ‘Is the time come?’—‘The time is come.’<br>
        Young, strong, and so full of life,<br>
          The agony struck them dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
        Close his arm about her now,<br>
          Close her cheek to his,<br>
        Close the pistol to her brow—<br>
          God forgive them this!
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Will it hurt much?’ ‘No, mine own:<br>
          I wish I could bear the pang for both.’—<br>
        ‘I wish I could bear the pang alone:<br>
          Courage, dear, I am not loth.’
      </p>

      <p>
        Kiss and kiss: ‘It is not pain<br>
          Thus to kiss and die.<br>
        One kiss more.’—‘And yet one again.’—<br>
          ‘Good-bye.’—‘Good-bye.’
