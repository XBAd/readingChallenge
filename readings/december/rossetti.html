          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti" target="_blank">Christina Georgina Rossetti</a>
           (5 December 1830 – 29 December 1894) was an English poet who wrote a
           variety of romantic, devotional, and children's poems. She is famous
           for "Goblin Market" and "Remember". She wrote the words of two Christmas
           carols well known in the British Isles: "In the Bleak Midwinter", later
           set to music by Gustav Holst and by Harold Darke, and "Love Came
           Down at Christmas", also set by Harold Darke and by other composers.

      <h2>Song</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN I am dead, my dearest, <br>
          Sing no sad songs for me;<br>
        Plant thou no roses at my head,<br>
          Nor shady cypress tree:<br>
        Be the green grass above me<br>
          With showers and dewdrops wet;<br>
        And if thou wilt, remember,<br>
          And if thou wilt, forget.
      </p>

      <p>
        I shall not see the shadows,<br>
          I shall not feel the rain;<br>
        I shall not hear the nightingale<br>
          Sing on, as if in pain;<br>
        And dreaming through the twilight<br>
          That doth not rise nor set,<br>
        Haply I may remember,<br>
          And haply may forget.
      </p>

      <h2>Remember</h2>

      <p>
        REMEMBER me when I am gone away,<br>
          Gone far away into the silent land;<br>
          When you can no more hold me by the hand,<br>
        Nor I half turn to go, yet turning stay.<br>
        Remember me when no more day by day<br>
          You tell me of our future that you plann’d:<br>
          Only remember me; you understand<br>
        It will be late to counsel then or pray.<br>
        Yet if you should forget me for a while<br>
          And afterwards remember, do not grieve:<br>
          For if the darkness and corruption leave<br>
          A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,<br>
        Better by far you should forget and smile<br>
          Than that you should remember and be sad.
      </p>

      <h2>Up-Hill</h2>

      <p>
        DOES the road wind up-hill all the way?<br>
          Yes, to the very end.<br>
        Will the day’s journey take the whole long day?<br>
          From morn to night, my friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        But is there for the night a resting-place?<br>
          A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.<br>
        May not the darkness hide it from my face?<br>
          You cannot miss that inn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?<br>
          Those who have gone before.<br>
        Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?<br>
          They will not keep you standing at that door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?<br>
          Of labour you shall find the sum.<br>
        Will there be beds for me and all who seek?<br>
          Yea, beds for all who come.
      </p>

      <h2>In the Round Tower at Jhansi</h2>

      <h2>June 8, 1857 (Indian Mutiny)</h2>

      <p>
        A HUNDRED, a thousand to one: even so;<br>
          Not a hope in the world remained:<br>
        The swarming howling wretches below<br>
          Gained and gained and gained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skene looked at his pale young wife.<br>
          ‘Is the time come?’—‘The time is come.’<br>
        Young, strong, and so full of life,<br>
          The agony struck them dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
        Close his arm about her now,<br>
          Close her cheek to his,<br>
        Close the pistol to her brow—<br>
          God forgive them this!
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Will it hurt much?’ ‘No, mine own:<br>
          I wish I could bear the pang for both.’—<br>
        ‘I wish I could bear the pang alone:<br>
          Courage, dear, I am not loth.’
      </p>

      <p>
        Kiss and kiss: ‘It is not pain<br>
          Thus to kiss and die.<br>
        One kiss more.’—‘And yet one again.’—<br>
          ‘Good-bye.’—‘Good-bye.’
