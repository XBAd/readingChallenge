      <h2>A Garden</h2>

      <p>
        SEE how the flowers, as at parade, <br>
        Under their colours stand display’d:<br>
        Each regiment in order grows,<br>
        That of the tulip, pink, and rose.<br>
        But when the vigilant patrol<br>
        Of stars walks round about the pole,<br>
        Their leaves, that to the stalks are curl’d<br>
        Seem to their staves the ensigns furl’d.<br>
        Then in some flower’s belovèd hut<br>
        Each bee, as sentinel, is shut,<br>
        And sleeps so too; but if once stirr’d,<br>
        She runs you through, nor asks the word.<br>
        O thou, that dear and happy Isle,<br>
        The garden of the world erewhile,<br>
        Thou Paradise of the four seas<br>
        Which Heaven planted us to please,<br>
        But, to exclude the world, did guard<br>
        With wat’ry if not flaming sword;<br>
        What luckless apple did we taste<br>
        To make us mortal and thee waste!<br>
        Unhappy! shall we never more<br>
        That sweet militia restore,<br>
        When gardens only had their towers,<br>
        And all the garrisons were flowers;<br>
        When roses only arms might bear,<br>
        And men did rosy garlands wear?
      </p>

      <h2>The Picture of Little T. C. in a Prospect of Flowers</h2>

      <p>
        SEE with what simplicity<br>
           This nymph begins her golden days!<br>
             In the green grass she loves to lie,<br>
         And there with her fair aspect tames<br>
         The wilder flowers, and gives them names;<br>
           But only with the roses plays,<br>
                   And them does tell<br>
       What colour best becomes them, and what smell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who can foretell for what high cause<br>
      This darling of the gods was born?<br>
        Yet this is she whose chaster laws<br>
    The wanton Love shall one day fear,<br>
    And, under her command severe,<br>
      See his bow broke and ensigns torn.<br>
              Happy who can<br>
  Appease this virtuous enemy of man!
      </p>

      <p>
        O then let me in time compound<br>
      And parley with those conquering eyes,<br>
        Ere they have tried their force to wound;<br>
    Ere with their glancing wheels they drive<br>
    In triumph over hearts that strive,<br>
      And them that yield but more despise:<br>
              Let me be laid,<br>
  Where I may see the glories from some shade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meantime, whilst every verdant thing<br>
      Itself does at thy beauty charm,<br>
        Reform the errors of the Spring;<br>
    Make that the tulips may have share<br>
    Of sweetness, seeing they are fair,<br>
      And roses of their thorns disarm;<br>
              But most procure<br>
  That violets may a longer age endure.
      </p>

      <p>
        But O, young beauty of the woods,<br>
      Whom Nature courts with fruits and flowers,<br>
        Gather the flowers, but spare the buds;<br>
    Lest Flora, angry at thy crime<br>
    To kill her infants in their prime,<br>
      Do quickly make th’ example yours;<br>
              And ere we see,<br>
  Nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee.
      </p>

      <h2>Horatian Ode upon Cromwell’s Return from Ireland</h2>

      <p>
        THE FORWARD youth that would appear,<br>
        Must now forsake his Muses dear,<br>
            Nor in the shadows sing<br>
            His numbers languishing.
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Tis time to leave the books in dust,<br>
        And oil the unused armour’s rust,<br>
            Removing from the wall<br>
            The corslet of the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        So restless Cromwell could not cease<br>
        In the inglorious arts of peace,<br>
            But through adventurous war<br>
            Urgèd his active star:
      </p>

      <p>
        And like the three-fork’d lightning, first<br>
        Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,<br>
            Did thorough his own side<br>
            His fiery way divide:
      </p>

      <p>
        For ’tis all one to courage high,<br>
        The emulous, or enemy;<br>
            And with such, to enclose<br>
            Is more than to oppose;
      </p>

      <p>
        Then burning through the air he went<br>
        And palaces and temples rent;<br>
            And Cæsar’s head at last<br>
            Did through his laurels blast.
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Tis madness to resist or blame<br>
        The face of angry heaven’s flame:<br>
            And if we would speak true,<br>
            Much to the Man is due
      </p>

      <p>
        Who, from his private gardens, where<br>
        He lived reservèd and austere,<br>
            (As if his highest plot<br>
            To plant the bergamot),
      </p>

      <p>
        Could by industrious valour climb<br>
        To ruin the great work of time,<br>
            And cast the Kingdoms old<br>
            Into another mould.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though Justice against Fate complain,<br>
        And plead the ancient Rights in vain—<br>
            But those do hold or break<br>
            As men are strong or weak,
      </p>

      <p>
        Nature, that hateth emptiness,<br>
        Allows of penetration less,<br>
            And therefore must make room<br>
            Where greater spirits come.
      </p>

      <p>
        What field of all the civil war<br>
        Where his were not the deepest scar?<br>
            And Hampton shows what part<br>
            He had of wiser art,
      </p>

      <p>
        Where, twining subtle fears with hope,<br>
        He wove a net of such a scope<br>
            That Charles himself might chase<br>
            To Carisbrook’s narrow case,
      </p>

      <p>
        That thence the Royal actor borne<br>
        The tragic scaffold might adorn:<br>
            While round the armèd bands<br>
            Did clap their bloody hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        He nothing common did or mean<br>
        Upon that memorable scene,<br>
            But with his keener eye<br>
            The axe’s edge did try;
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor call’d the Gods, with vulgar spite,<br>
        To vindicate his helpless right<br>
            But bow’d his comely head<br>
            Down, as upon a bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        —This was that memorable hour<br>
        Which first assured the forcèd power:<br>
            So when they did design<br>
            The Capitol’s first line,
      </p>

      <p>
        A Bleeding Head, where they begun,<br>
        Did fright the architects to run;<br>
            And yet in that the State<br>
            Foresaw its happy fate!
      </p>

      <p>
        And now the Irish are ashamed<br>
        To see themselves in one year tamed:<br>
            So much one man can do<br>
            That does both act and know.
      </p>

      <p>
        They can affirm his praises best,<br>
        And have, though overcome, confest<br>
            How good he is, how just<br>
            And fit for highest trust;
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor yet grown stiffer with command,<br>
        But still in the Republic’s hand—<br>
            How fit he is to sway<br>
            That can so well obey!
      </p>

      <p>
        He to the Commons’ feet presents<br>
        A Kingdom for his first year’s rents,<br>
            And (what he may) forbears<br>
            His fame, to make it theirs:
      </p>

      <p>
        And has his sword and spoils ungirt<br>
        To lay them at the Public’s skirt.<br>
            So when the falcon high<br>
            Falls heavy from the sky,
      </p>

      <p>
        She, having kill’d, no more does search<br>
        But on the next green bough to perch,<br>
            Where, when he first does lure,<br>
            The falconer has her sure.
      </p>

      <p>
        —What may not then our Isle presume<br>
        While victory his crest does plume?<br>
            What may not others fear<br>
            If thus he crowns each year?
      </p>

      <p>
        As Cæsar he, ere long, to Gaul,<br>
        To Italy an Hannibal,<br>
            And to all States not free<br>
            Shall climacteric be.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Pict no shelter now shall find<br>
        Within his parti-colour’d mind,<br>
            But from this valour sad,<br>
            Shrink underneath the plaid—
      </p>

      <p>
        Happy, if in the tufted brake<br>
        The English hunter him mistake,<br>
            Nor lay his hounds in near<br>
            The Caledonian deer.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Thou, the War’s and Fortune’s son,<br>
        March indefatigably on;<br>
            And for the last effect<br>
            Still keep the sword erect:
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides the force it has to fright<br>
        The spirits of the shady night,<br>
            The same arts that did gain<br>
            A power, must it maintain.
      </p>

      <h2>Song of the Emigrants in Bermuda</h2>

      <p>
        WHERE the remote Bermudas ride<br>
        In the ocean’s bosom unespied,<br>
        From a small boat that row’d along<br>
        The listening winds received this song:
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘What should we do but sing His praise<br>
      That led us through the watery maze<br>
      Where He the huge sea-monsters wracks,<br>
      That lift the deep upon their backs,<br>
      Unto an isle so long unknown,<br>
      And yet far kinder than our own?<br>
      He lands us on a grassy stage,<br>
      Safe from the storms, and prelate’s rage:<br>
      He gave us this eternal spring<br>
      Which here enamels everything,<br>
      And sends the fowls to us in care<br>
      On daily visits through the air.<br>
      He hangs in shades the orange bright<br>
      Like golden lamps in a green night,<br>
      And does in the pomegranates close<br>
      Jewels more rich than Ormus shows:<br>
      He makes the figs our mouths to meet<br>
      And throws the melons at our feet;<br>
      But apples plants of such a price,<br>
      No tree could ever bear them twice.<br>
      With cedars chosen by his hand<br>
      From Lebanon he stores the land;<br>
      And makes the hollow seas that roar<br>
      Proclaim the ambergris on shore.<br>
      He cast (of which we rather boast)<br>
      The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast;<br>
      And in these rocks for us did frame<br>
      A temple where to sound His name.<br>
      Oh! let our voice His praise exalt<br>
      Till it arrive at Heaven’s vault,<br>
      Which then perhaps rebounding may<br>
      Echo beyond the Mexique bay!’<br>
      —Thus sung they in the English boat<br>
      A holy and a cheerful note:<br>
      And all the way, to guide their chime,<br>
      With falling oars they kept the time.
      </p>

      <h2>Thoughts in a Garden</h2>

      <p>
        HOW vainly men themselves amaze<br>
        To win the palm, the oak, or bays,<br>
        And their incessant labours see<br>
        Crown’d from some single herb or tree,<br>
        Whose short and narrow-vergèd shade<br>
        Does prudently their toils upbraid;<br>
        While all the flowers and trees do close<br>
        To weave the garlands of Repose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,<br>
        And Innocence thy sister dear?<br>
        Mistaken long, I sought you then<br>
        In busy companies of men:<br>
        Your sacred plants, if here below,<br>
        Only among the plants will grow:<br>
        Society is all but rude<br>
        To this delicious solitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        No white nor red was ever seen<br>
        So amorous as this lovely green.<br>
        Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,<br>
        Cut in these trees their mistress’ name:<br>
        Little, alas, they know or heed<br>
        How far these beauties her exceed!<br>
        Fair trees! where’er your barks I wound,<br>
        No name shall but your own be found.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have run our passions’ heat<br>
        Love hither makes his best retreat:<br>
        The gods, who mortal beauty chase,<br>
        Still in a tree did end their race;<br>
        Apollo hunted Daphne so<br>
        Only that she might laurel grow;<br>
        And Pan did after Syrinx speed<br>
        Not as a nymph, but for a reed.
      </p>

      <p>
        What wondrous life is this I lead!<br>
        Ripe apples drop about my head;<br>
        The luscious clusters of the vine<br>
        Upon my mouth do crush their wine;<br>
        The nectarine and curious peach<br>
        Into my hands themselves do reach;<br>
        Stumbling on melons, as I pass,<br>
        Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less<br>
        Withdraws into its happiness;<br>
        The mind, that ocean where each kind<br>
        Does straight its own resemblance find;<br>
        Yet it creates, transcending these,<br>
        Far other worlds, and other seas;<br>
        Annihilating all that’s made<br>
        To a green thought in a green shade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here at the fountain’s sliding foot<br>
        Or at some fruit-tree’s mossy root,<br>
        Casting the body’s vest aside<br>
        My soul into the boughs does glide;<br>
        There, like a bird, it sits and sings,<br>
        Then whets and claps its silver wings,<br>
        And, till prepared for longer flight,<br>
        Waves in its plumes the various light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such was that happy Garden-state<br>
        While man there walk’d without a mate:<br>
        After a place so pure and sweet,<br>
        What other help could yet be meet!<br>
        But ’twas beyond a mortal’s share<br>
        To wander solitary there:<br>
        Two paradises ’twere in one,<br>
        To live in Paradise alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        How well the skilful gardener drew<br>
        Of flowers and herbs this dial new!<br>
        Where, from above, the milder sun<br>
        Does through a fragrant zodiac run:<br>
        And, as it works, th’ industrious bee<br>
        Computes its time as well as we.<br>
        How could such sweet and wholesome hours<br>
        Be reckon’d, but with herbs and flowers!
