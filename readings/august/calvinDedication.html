        <span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">o His Most Christian Majesty</span>, FRANCIS, King of the French, and
his Sovereign, John Calvin wisheth peace and salvation in Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I began this work, Sire, nothing was further from
my thoughts than writing a book which would afterwards
be presented to your Majesty. My intention was only to
lay down some elementary principles, by which inquirers on the
subject of religion might be instructed in the nature of true piety.
And this labour I undertook chiefly for my countrymen, the French,
of whom I apprehended multitudes to be hungering and thirsting
after Christ, but saw very few possessing any real knowledge of him.
That this was my design, the book itself proves by its simple method
and unadorned composition. But when I perceived that the fury of
certain wicked men in your kingdom had grown to such a height,
as to leave no room in the land for sound doctrine, I thought I should
be usefully employed, if in the same work I delivered my instructions
to them, and exhibited my confession to you, that you may know
the nature of that doctrine, which is the object of such unbounded
rage to those madmen who are now disturbing the country with
fire and sword. For I shall not be afraid to acknowledge, that this
treatise contains a summary of that very doctrine, which, according
to their clamours, deserves to be punished with imprisonment, banishment,
proscription, and flames, and to be exterminated from the face of the earth. I well know with what atrocious insinuations your ears have been filled by them, in order to render our cause most odious
in your esteem; but your clemency should lead you to consider that,
if accusation be accounted a sufficient evidence of guilt, there will be an end of all innocence in words and actions. If any one, indeed,
with a view to bring odium upon the doctrine which I am endeavouring
to defend, should allege that it has long ago been condemned
by the general consent, and suppressed by many judicial decisions,
this will be only equivalent to saying, that it has been sometimes
violently rejected through the influence and power of its adversaries,
and sometimes insidiously and fraudulently oppressed by falsehoods,
artifices, and calumnies. Violence is displayed, when sanguinary
sentences are passed against it without the cause being heard; and
fraud, when it is unjustly accused of sedition and mischief. Lest any one should suppose that these our complaints are unfounded,
you yourself. Sire, can bear witness of the false calumnies with
which you hear it daily traduced; that its only tendency is to wrest
the sceptres of kings out of their hands, to overturn all the tribunals and judicial proceedings, to subvert all order and governments, to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the people, to abrogate all laws,
to scatter all properties and possessions, and, in a word, to involve
every thing in total confusion. And yet you hear the smallest portion of what is alleged against it; for such horrible things are circulated
amongst the vulgar, that, if they were true, the whole world
would justly pronounce it and its abettors worthy of a thousand fires and gibbets. Who, then, will wonder at its becoming the object of public odium, where credit is given to such most iniquitous accusations?
This is the cause of the general consent and conspiracy to condemn us and our doctrine. Hurried away with this impulse, those who sit in judgment pronounce for sentences the prejudices they
brought from home with them; and think their duty fully discharged
if they condemn none to be punished but such as are convicted by
their own confession, or by sufficient proofs. Convicted of what
crime? Of this condemned doctrine, they say. But with what justice
is it condemned? Now, the ground of defence was not to abjure the doctrine itself, but to maintain its truth. On this subject, however,
not a word is allowed to be uttered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wherefore I beseech you, Sire, — and surely it is not an unreasonable
request, — to take upon yourself the entire cognizance of this cause, which has hitherto been confusedly and carelessly agitated,
without any order of law, and with outrageous passion rather than
judicial gravity. Think not that I am now meditating my own
individual defence, in order to effect a safe return to my native
country; for, though I feel the affection which every man ought to
feel for it, yet, under the existing circumstances, I regret not my
removal from it. But I plead the cause of all the godly, and consequently of Christ himself, which, having been in these times persecuted and trampled on in all ways in your kingdom, now lies in a most deplorable state; and this indeed rather through the tyranny
of certain Pharisees, than with your knowledge. How this comes
to pass is foreign to my present purpose to say; but it certainly lies in a most afflicted state. For the ungodly have gone to such lengths,
that the truth of Christ, if not vanquished, dissipated, and entirely
destroyed, is buried, as it were, in ignoble obscurity, while the poor, despised church is either destroyed by cruel massacres, or driven
away into banishment, or menaced and terrified into total silence. And still they continue their wonted madness and ferocity, pushing
violently against the wall already bent, and finishing the ruin they
have begun. In the meantime, no one comes forward to plead the
cause against such furies. If there be any persons desirous of appearing most favourable to the truth, they only venture an opinion, that forgiveness should be extended to the error and imprudence of ignorant people. For this is the language of these moderate men,
calling that error and imprudence which they know to be the certain truth of God, and those ignorant people, whose understanding they
perceive not to have been so despicable to Christ, but that he has
favoured them with the mysteries of his heavenly wisdom. Thus all are ashamed of the Gospel. But it shall be yours. Sire, not to turn away your ears or thoughts from so just a defence, especially in a
cause of such importance as the maintenance of God's glory unimpaired
in the world, the preservation of the honor of divine truth,
and the continuance of the kingdom of Christ uninjured among us. This is a cause worthy of your attention, worthy of your cognizance,
worthy of your throne. This consideration constitutes true royalty, to acknowledge yourself in the government o£ your kingdom to be
the minister of God. For where the glory of God is not made the end of the government, it is not a legitimate sovereignty, but a usurpation. And he is deceived who expects lasting prosperity in that kingdom which is not ruled by the sceptre of God, that is, his holy word; for that heavenly oracle cannot fail, which declares that "where there is no vision, the people perish.'" Nor should you be
seduced from this pursuit by a contempt of our meanness. We are
fully conscious to ourselves how very mean and abject we are, being
miserable sinners before God, and accounted most despicable by
men; being (if you please) the refuse of the world, deserving of the
vilest appellations that can be found; so that nothing remains for us
to glory in before God, but his mercy alone, by which, without any
merit of ours, we have been admitted to the hope of eternal salvation,
and before men nothing but our weakness, the slightest confession of which is esteemed by them as the greatest disgrace. But our doctrine
must stand, exalted above all the glory, and invincible by all the power of the world; because it is not ours, but the doctrine of the living God, and of his Christ, whom the Father hath constituted King, that he may have dominion from sea to sea, and from the
river even to the ends of the earth, and that he may rule in such a manner, that the whole earth, with its strength of iron and with its splendour of gold and silver, smitten by the rod of his mouth, may be
broken to pieces like a potter's vessel; for thus do the prophets foretell
the magnificence of his kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our adversaries reply, that our pleading the word of God is a
false pretence, and that we are nefarious corrupters of it. But that
this is not only a malicious calumny, but egregious impudence, by
reading our confession, you will, in your wisdom, be able to judge.
Yet something further is necessary to be said, to excite your attention, or at least to prepare your mind for this perusal. Paul's direction, that every prophecy be framed "according to the analogy of faith,"
has fixed an invariable standard by which all interpretation of Scripture ought to be tried. If our principles be examined by this rule of
faith, the victory is ours. For what is more consistent with faith than
to acknowledge ourselves naked of all virtue, that we may be clothed by God; empty of all good, that we may be filled by him; slaves to
sin, that we may be liberated by him; blind, that we may be enlightened
by him; lame, that we may be guided; weak, that we may be
supported by him; to divest ourselves of all ground of glorying, that he alone may be eminently glorious, and that we may glory in him?
When we advance these and similar sentiments, they interrupt us with complaints that this is the way to overturn, I know not what
blind light of nature, pretended preparations, free will, and works
meritorious of eternal salvation, together with all their supererogations;
because they cannot bear that the praise and glory of all goodness, strength, righteousness, and wisdom, should remain entirely
with God. But we read of none being reproved for having
drawn too freely from the fountain of living waters; on the contrary,
they are severely upbraided who have "hewed them out cisterns,
broken cisterns, that can hold no water." Again, what is more
consistent with faith, than to assure ourselves of God being a propitious
Father, where Christ is acknowledged as a brother and
Mediator? than securely to expect all prosperity and happiness from
Him, whose unspeakable love towards us went so far, that "he
spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us?" than to rest in the certain expectation of salvation and eternal life, when we
reflect upon the Father's gift of Christ, in whom such treasures are hidden? Here they oppose us, and complain that this certainty of confidence is chargeable with arrogance and presumption. But as we
ought to presume nothing of ourselves, so we should presume every
thing of God; nor are we divested of vain glory for any other reason than that we may learn to glory in the Lord. What shall I say more?
Review, Sire, all the parts of our cause, and consider us worse than
the most abandoned of mankind, unless you clearly discover that we
thus "both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living
God," because we believe that "this is life eternal, to know the only
true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent." For this hope some
of us are bound in chains, others are lashed with scourges, others
are carried about as laughing-stocks, others are outlawed, others are
cruelly tortured, others escape by light; but we are all reduced to extreme perplexities, execrated with dreadful curses, cruelly slandered and treated with the greatest indignities. Now, look at our adversaries,
(I speak of the order of priests, at whose will and directions others carry on these hostilities against us,) and consider a little with
me by what principles they are actuated. The true religion, which
is taught in the Scriptures, and ought to be universally maintained,
they readily permit both themselves and others to be ignorant of, and to treat with neglect and contempt. They think it unimportant
what any one holds or denies concerning God and Christ, provided
he submits his mind with an implicit faith (as they call it) to the judgment of the Church. Nor are they much affected, if the glory
of God happens to be violated with open blasphemies, provided no
one lift a finger against the primacy of the Apostolic See, and the authority of their holy Mother Church. Why, therefore, do they
contend with such extreme bitterness and cruelty for the mass, purgatory,
pilgrimages, and similar trifles, and deny that any piety can be maintained without a most explicit faith, so to speak, in these things; whereas they prove none of them from the word of God?
Why, but because their belly is their God, their kitchen is their religion; deprived of which they consider themselves no longer as Christians,
or even as men. For though some feast themselves in splendour,
and others subsist on slender fare, yet all live on the same pot,
which, without this fuel, would not only cool, but completely freeze. Every one of them, therefore, who is most solicitous for his belly,
is found to be a most strenuous champion for their faith. Indeed,
they universally exert themselves for the preservation of their kingdom,
and the repletion of their bellies; but not one of them discovers the least indication of sincere zeal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor do their attacks on our doctrine cease here; they urge every
topic of accusation and abuse to render it an object of hatred or
suspicion. They call it novel, and of recent origin, — they cavil at
it as doubtful and uncertain, — they inquire by what miracles it is confirmed, — they ask whether it is right for it to be received contrary
to the consent of so many holy fathers, and the custom of the highest antiquity, — they urge us to confess that it is schismatical in
stirring up opposition against the Church, or that the Church was
wholly extinct for many ages, during which no such thing was known. — Lastly, they say all arguments are unnecessary; for that its nature may be determined by its fruits, since it has produced such a multitude of sects, so many factious tumults, and such great licentiousness of vices. It is indeed very easy for them to insult a deserted cause with the credulous and ignorant multitude; but, if we had also the liberty of speaking in our turn, this acrimony, which they now
discover in violently foaming against us with equal licentiousness and impunity, would presently cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the first place, their calling it novel is highly injurious to God,
whose holy word deserves not to be accused of novelty. I have no
doubt of its being new to them, to whom Jesus Christ and the Gospel
are equally new. But those who know the antiquity of this preaching
of Paul, "that Jesus Christ died for our sins, and rose again for our justification," will find no novelty among us. That it has long
been concealed, buried, and unknown, is the crime of human impiety.
Now that the goodness of God has restored it to us, it ought
at least to be allowed its just claim of antiquity.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the same source of ignorance springs the notion of its being
doubtful and uncertain. This is the very thing which the Lord complains
of by his prophet; that "the ox knoweth his owner, and the
ass his master's crib," but that his people know not him. But however
they may laugh at its uncertainty, if they were called to seal their own doctrine with their blood and lives, it would appear how much
they value it. Very different is our confidence, which dreads neither the terrors of death, nor even the tribunal of God.
