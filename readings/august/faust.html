        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe%27s_Faust" target="_blank"><em>Faust</em></a>
           is a tragic play in two parts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
          usually known in English as <em>Faust, Part One</em> and <em>Faust, Part Two</em>.
          Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest
          audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is considered by many
          to be Goethe's magnum opus and the greatest work of German literature.
          The earliest forms of the work, known as the <em>Urfaust</em>,
          were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of
          that development are not entirely clear. Goethe finished writing
          Faust Part Two in 1831; it was published posthumously the following year.
          In contrast to Faust Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of
          Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena
          such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical
          and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal
          occupation of Goethe's last years.

      <h3>NIGHT. STREET BEFORE MARGARET’S DOOR</h3>

      <h3>VALENTINE  (a soldier, MARGARET’S brother)</h3>

      <p>
      When seated ’mong the jovial crowd, <br>
      Where merry comrades boasting loud<br>
      Each named with pride his favourite lass,<br>
      And in her honour drain’d his glass;<br>
      Upon my elbows I would lean,<br>
      With easy quiet view the scene,<br>
      Nor give my tongue the rein until<br>
      Each swaggering blade had talked his fill.<br>
      Then smiling I my beard would stroke,<br>
      The while, with brimming glass, I spoke;<br>
      “Each to his taste!—but to my mind,<br>
      Where in the country will you find,<br>
      A maid, as my dear Gretchen fair,<br>
      Who with my sister can compare?”<br>
      Cling! Clang! so rang the jovial sound!<br>
      Shouts of assent went circling round;<br>
      Pride of her sex is she!—cried some;<br>
      Then were the noisy boasters dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
      And now!—I could tear out my hair,<br>
      Or dash my brains out in despair!—<br>
      Me every scurvy knave may <span class="tooltip">twit<span class="tooltiptext">tease or taunt (someone), especially in a good-humored way.</span></span>,<br>
      With stinging jest and taunting sneer!<br>
      Like skulking debtor I must sit,<br>
      And sweat each casual word to hear!<br>
      And though I smash’d them one and all,—<br>
      Yet them I could not liars call.
      </p>

      <p>
          Who comes this way? who’s sneaking here?<br>
          If I mistake not, two draw near.<br>
          If he be one, have at him;—well I wot<br>
          Alive he shall not leave this spot!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
      How from yon <span class="tooltip">sacristy<span class="tooltiptext">a room in a church where a priest prepares for a service, and where vestments and other things used in worship are kept.</span></span>, athwart the night,<br>
      Its beams the ever-burning taper throws,<br>
      While ever waning, fades the glimmering light,<br>
      As gathering darkness doth around it close!<br>
      So night-like gloom doth in my bosom reign.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
      I’m like a tom-cat in a thievish vein,<br>
      That up fire-ladders tall and steep,<br>
      And round the walls doth slyly creep;<br>
      Virtuous withal, I feel, with, I confess,<br>
      A touch of thievish joy and wantonness.<br>
      Thus through my limbs already burns<br>
      The glorious <span class="tooltip">Walpurgis night<span class="tooltiptext">a traditional holiday celebrated on April 30 in northern Europe and Scandinavia.</span></span>!<br>
      After to-morrow it returns,<br>
      Then why one wakes, one knows aright!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
      Meanwhile, the treasure I see glimmering there,<br>
      Will it ascend into the open air?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
      Ere long thou wilt proceed with pleasure,<br>
      To raise the casket with its treasure;<br>
      I took a peep, therein are stored,<br>
      Of lion-dollars a rich hoard.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
      And not a trinket? not a ring?<br>
      Wherewith my lovely girl to deck?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
      I saw among them some such thing,<br>
      A string of pearls to grace her neck.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
      ’Tis well! I’m always loath to go,<br>
      Without some gift my love to show.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
      Some pleasures gratis to enjoy,<br>
      Should surely cause you no annoy.<br>
      While bright with stars the heavens appear,<br>
      I’ll sing a masterpiece of art:<br>
      A moral song shall charm her ear,<br>
      More surely to beguile her heart.  (Sings to the guitar.)<br>
      Kathrina say,<br>
      Why lingering stay<br>
      At dawn of day<br>
      Before your lover’s door?<br>
      Maiden, beware,<br>
      Nor enter there,<br>
      Lest forth you fare,<br>
      A maiden never more.
      </p>

      <p>
      Maiden take heed!<br>
      Reck well my <span class="tooltip">rede<span class="tooltiptext">advice or counsel given by one person to another.</span></span>!<br>
      Is’t done, the deed?<br>
      Good night, you poor, poor thing!<br>
      The spoiler’s lies,<br>
      His arts despise,<br>
      Nor yield your prize,<br>
      Without the marriage ring!
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE  (steps forward)</h3>

      <p>
      Whom are you luring here? I’ll give it you!<br>
      Accursed rat-catchers, your strains I’ll end!<br>
      First, to the devil the guitar I’ll send!<br>
      Then to the devil with the singer too!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
      The poor guitar! ’tis done for now.
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
      Your skull shall follow next, I <span class="tooltip">trow<span class="tooltiptext">think or believe.</span></span>!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES  (to FAUST)</h3>

      <p>
      Doctor, stand fast! your strength collect!<br>
      Be prompt, and do as I direct.<br>
      Out with your whisk, keep close, I pray,<br>
      I’ll parry! do you thrust away!
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
      Then parry that!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
                      Why not?
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
                      That too!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
      With ease!
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
                  The devil fights for you!<br>
      Why how is this? my hand’s already lamed!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES  (to FAUST)</h3>

      <p>
      Thrust home!
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE  (falls)</h3>

      <p>
                    Alas!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
                      There! Now the <span class="tooltip">lubber<span class="tooltiptext">a big, clumsy person.</span></span>’s tamed!<br>
      But quick, away! We must at once take wing;<br>
      A cry of murder strikes upon the ear;<br>
      With the police I know my course to steer,<br>
      But with the blood-ban ’tis another thing.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (at the window)</h3>

      <p>
      Without! Without!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET  (at the window)</h3>

      <p>
                      Quick, bring a light!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (as above)</h3>

      <p>
      They rail and scuffle, scream and fight!
      </p>

      <h3>PEOPLE</h3>

      <p>
      One lieth here already dead!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (coming out)</h3>

      <p>
      Where are the murderers? are they fled?
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET  (coming out)</h3>

      <p>
      Who lieth here?
      </p>

      <h3>PEOPLE</h3>

      <p>
                      Thy mother’s son.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
      Almighty God! I am undone!
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
      I’m dying—’tis a soon-told tale,<br>
      And sooner done the deed.<br>
      Why, women, do ye howl and wail?<br>
      To my last words give heed!  (All gather round him.)<br>
      My Gretchen see! still young art thou,<br>
      Art not discreet enough, I trow,<br>
      Thou dost thy matters ill;<br>
      Let this in confidence be said:<br>
      Since thou the path of shame dost tread,<br>
      Tread it with right good will!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
      My brother! God! what can this mean?
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
                      Abstain,<br>
      Nor dare God’s holy name profane!<br>
      What’s done, alas, is done and past!<br>
      Matters will take their course at last;<br>
      By stealth thou dost begin with one,<br>
      Others will follow him <span class="tooltip">anon<span class="tooltiptext">shortly; soon</span></span>;<br>
      And when a dozen thee have known,<br>
      Thou’lt common be to all the town.<br>
      When infamy is newly born,<br>
      In secret she is brought to light,<br>
      And the mysterious veil of night<br>
      O’er head and ears is drawn;<br>
      The loathsome birth men <span class="tooltip">fain<span class="tooltiptext">with pleasure; gladly.</span></span> would slay;<br>
      But soon, full grown, she waxes bold,<br>
      And though not fairer to behold,<br>
      With brazen front insults the day:<br>
      The more abhorrent to the sight,<br>
      The more she courts the day’s pure light.
      </p>

      <p>
      The time already I discern,<br>
      When thee all honest folk will spurn,<br>
      And shun thy hated form to meet,<br>
      As when a corpse infects the street.<br>
      Thy heart will sink in blank despair,<br>
      When they shall look thee in the face!<br>
      A golden chain no more thou’lt wear!<br>
      Nor near the altar take in church thy place!<br>
      In fair lace collar simply <span class="tooltip">dight<span class="tooltiptext">clothed or equipped.</span></span><br>
      Thou’lt dance no more with spirits light!<br>
      In darksome corners thou wilt bide,<br>
      Where beggars vile and cripples hide,<br>
      And e’en though God thy crime forgive,<br>
      On earth, a thing accursed, thou’lt live!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
      Your parting soul to God commend!<br>
      Your dying breath in slander will you spend?
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
      Could I but reach thy wither’d frame,<br>
      Thou wretched <span class="tooltip">beldame<span class="tooltiptext">a malicious and ugly woman, especially an old one; a witch.</span></span>, void of shame!<br>
      Full measure I might hope to win<br>
      Of pardon then for every sin.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
      Brother! what agonizing pain!
      </p>

      <h3>VALENTINE</h3>

      <p>
      I tell thee, from vain tears abstain!<br>
      ’Twas thy dishonour pierced my heart,<br>
      Thy fall the fatal death-stab gave.<br>
      Through the death-sleep I now depart<br>
      To God, a soldier true and brave.  (dies.)

      <h3>EVIL-SPIRIT behind MARGARET</h3>
      <h3>EVIL-SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
      How different, Gretchen, was it once with thee,<br>
      When thou, still full of innocence,<br>
      Here to the altar camest,<br>
      And from the small and well-conn’d book<br>
      Didst lisp thy prayer,<br>
      Half childish sport,<br>
      Half God in thy young heart!<br>
      Gretchen!<br>
      What thoughts are thine?<br>
      What deed of shame<br>
      Lurks in thy sinful heart?<br>
      Is thy prayer utter’d for thy mother’s soul,<br>
      Who into long, long torment slept through thee?<br>
      Whose blood is on thy threshold?<br>
      —And stirs there not already ’neath thy heart<br>
      Another quick’ning pulse, that even now<br>
      Tortures itself and thee<br>
      With its foreboding presence?
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
      Woe! Woe!<br>
      Oh could I free me from the thoughts<br>
      That hither, thither, crowd upon my brain,<br>
      Against my will!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
          Dies iræ, dies illa,<br>
          Solvet sæclum in favilla.  (The organ sounds.)
      </p>

      <h3>EVIL-SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
      Grim horror seizes thee!<br>
      The trumpet sounds!<br>
      The graves are shaken!<br>
      And thy heart<br>
      From ashy rest<br>
      For torturing flames<br>
      A new created,<br>
      Trembles into life!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
      Would I were hence!<br>
      It is as if the organ<br>
      Choked my breath,<br>
      As if the choir<br>
      Melted my inmost heart!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
          Judex ergo cum sedebit,<br>
          Quidquid latet adparebit,<br>
          Nil inultum remanebit.

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
      I feel oppressed!<br>
      The pillars of the wall<br>
      Imprison me!<br>
      The vaulted roof<br>
      Weighs down upon me!—air!

      Remain not hidden!<br>
