        THE ARGUMENT.—Satan, now in prospect of Eden, and nigh the place where he must now attempt the bold enterprise which he undertook alone against God and Man, falls into many doubts with himself, and many passions—fear, envy, and despair; but at length confirms himself in evil; journeys on to Paradise, whose outward prospect and situation is described; overleaps the bounds; sits, in the shape of a Cormorant, on the Tree of Life, as highest in the Garden, to look about him. The Garden described; Satan’s first sight of Adam and Eve; his wonder at their excellent form and happy state, but with resolution to work their fall; overhears their discourse; thence gathers that the Tree of Knowledge was forbidden them to eat of under penalty of death, and thereon intends to found his temptation by seducing them to transgress; then leaves them a while, to know further of their state by some other means. Meanwhile Uriel, descending on a sunbeam, warns Gabriel, who had in charge the gate of Paradise, that some evil Spirit had escaped the Deep, and passed at noon by his Sphere, in the shape of a good Angel, down to Paradise, discovered after by his furious gestures in the Mount. Gabriel promises to find him ere morning. Night coming on, Adam and Eve discourse of going to their rest; their bower described; their evening worship. Gabriel, drawing forth his bands of night—watch to walk the rounds of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels to Adam’s bower, lest the evil Spirit should be there doing some harm to Adam or Eve sleeping: there they find him at the ear of Eve, tempting her in a dream, and bring him, though unwilling, to Gabriel; by whom questioned, he scornfully answers; prepares resistance; but, hindered by a sign from Heaven, flies out of Paradise.

      <p>
        O FOR that warning voice, which he who saw <br>
        The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud,<br>
        Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,<br>
        Came furious down to be revenged on men,<br>
        Woe to the inhabitants on Earth! that now,<br>
        While time was, our first parents had been warned<br>
        The coming of their secret Foe, and scaped,<br>
        Haply so scaped, his mortal snare! For now<br>
        Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,<br>
        The tempter, ere the accuser, of mankind,<br>
        To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss<br>
        Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell.<br>
        Yet not rejoicing in his speed, though bold<br>
        Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br>
        Begins his dire attempt; which, nigh the birth<br>
        Now rowling, boils in his tumultuous breast,<br>
        And like a devilish engine back recoils<br>
        Upon himself. Horror and doubt distract<br>
        His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir<br>
        The hell within him; for within him Hell<br>
        He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br>
        One step, no more than from Himself, can fly<br>
        By change of place. Now conscience wakes despair<br>
        That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory<br>
        Of what he was, what is, and what must be<br>
        Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue!<br>
        Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view<br>
        Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;<br>
        Sometimes towards Heaven and the full-blazing Sun,<br>
        Which now sat high in his meridian tower:<br>
        Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O thou that, with surpassing glory crowned,<br>
      Look’st from thy sole dominion like the god<br>
      Of this new World—at whose sight all the stars<br>
      Hide their diminished heads—to thee I call,<br>
      But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,<br>
      O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams,<br>
      That bring to my remembrance from what state<br>
      I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere,<br>
      Till pride and worse ambition threw me down,<br>
      Warring in Heaven against Heaven’s matchless King!<br>
      Ah, wherefore? He deserved no such return<br>
      From me, whom he created what I was<br>
      In that bright eminence, and with his good<br>
      Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.<br>
      What could be less than to afford him praise,<br>
      The easiest recompense, and pay him thanks,<br>
      How due? Yet all his good proved ill in me,<br>
      And wrought but malice. Lifted up so high,<br>
      I ’sdained subjection, and thought one step higher<br>
      Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br>
      The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br>
      So burthensome, still paying, still to owe;<br>
      Forgetful what from him I still received;<br>
      And understood not that a grateful mind<br>
      By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br>
      Indebted and discharged—what burden then?<br>
      Oh, had his powerful destiny ordained<br>
      Me some inferior Angel, I had stood<br>
      Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised<br>
      Ambition. Yet why not? Some other Power<br>
      As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,<br>
      Drawn to his part. But other Powers as great<br>
      Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within<br>
      Or from without to all temptations armed!<br>
      Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?<br>
      Thou hadst. Whom has thou then, or what, to accuse,<br>
      But Heaven’s free love dealt equally to all?<br>
      Be then his love accursed, since, love or hate,<br>
      To me alike it deals eternal woe.<br>
      Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will<br>
      Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br>
      Me miserable! which way shall I fly<br>
      Infinite wrauth and infinite despair?<br>
      Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;<br>
      And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep<br>
      Still threatening to devour me opens wide,<br>
      To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.<br>
      O, then, at last relent! Is there no place<br>
      Left for repentence, none for pardon left?<br>
      None left but by submission; and that word<br>
      Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame<br>
      Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced<br>
      With other promises and other vaunts<br>
      Than to submit, boasting I could subdue<br>
      The Omnipotent. Aye me! they little know<br>
      How dearly I abide that boast so vain,<br>
      Under what torments inwardly I groan.<br>
      While they adore me on the throne of Hell,<br>
      With diadem and sceptre high advanced,<br>
      The lower still I fall, only supreme<br>
      In misery: such joy ambition finds!<br>
      But say I could repent, and could obtain,<br>
      By act of grace, my former state; how soon<br>
      Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay<br>
      What feigned submission swore! Ease would recant<br>
      Vows made in pain, as violent and void<br>
      (For never can true reconcilement grow<br>
      Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep)<br>
      Which would but lead me to a worse relapse<br>
      And heavier fall: so should I purchase dear<br>
      Short intermission, bought with double smart.<br>
      This knows my Punisher; therefore as far<br>
      From granting he, as I from begging, peace.<br>
      All hope excluded thus, behold, instead<br>
      Of us, outcast, exiled, his new delight,<br>
      Mankind, created, and for him this World!<br>
      So farewell hope, and, with hope, farewell fear,<br>
      Farewell remorse! All good to me is lost;<br>
      Evil, be thou my Good: by thee at least<br>
      Divided empire with Heaven’s King I hold,<br>
      By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;<br>
      As Man ere long, and this new World, shall know.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face,<br>
      Thrice changed with pale—ire, envy, and despair;<br>
      Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed<br>
      Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld:<br>
      For Heavenly minds from such distempers foul<br>
      Are ever clear. Whereof he soon aware<br>
      Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,<br>
      Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br>
      That practised falsehood under saintly shew,<br>
      Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:<br>
      Yet not enough had practised to deceive<br>
      Uriel, once warned; whose eye pursued him down<br>
      The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount<br>
      Saw him disfigured, more than could befall<br>
      Spirit of happy sort: his gestures fierce<br>
      He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,<br>
      As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.
      </p>

      <p>
        So on he fares, and to the border comes<br>
      Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,<br>
      Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,<br>
      As with a rural mound, the champain head<br>
      Of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides<br>
      With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild.<br>
      Access denied; and overhead up-grew<br>
      Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,<br>
      Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,<br>
      A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend<br>
      Shade above shade, a woody theatre<br>
      Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops<br>
      The verdurous wall of Paradise up-sprung;<br>
      Which to our general Sire gave prospect large<br>
      Into his nether empire neighbouring round.<br>
      And higher than that wall a circling row<br>
      Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,<br>
      Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,<br>
      Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed;<br>
      On which the sun more glad impressed his beams<br>
      Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,<br>
      When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed<br>
      That lantskip. And of pure now purer air<br>
      Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires<br>
      Vernal delight and joy, able to drive<br>
      All sadness but despair. Now gentle gales,<br>
      Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense<br>
      Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole<br>
      Those balmy spoils. As when to them who sail<br>
      Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past<br>
      Mozambic, off at sea north-east winds blow<br>
      Sabean odours from the spicy shore<br>
      Of Araby the Blest, with such delay<br>
      Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league<br>
      Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles;<br>
      So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend<br>
      Who came their bane, though with them better pleased<br>
      Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume<br>
      That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse<br>
      Of Tobit’s son, and with a vengeance sent<br>
      From Media post to Ægypt, there fast bound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill<br>
      Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;<br>
      But further way found none; so thick entwined,<br>
      As one continued brake, the undergrowth<br>
      Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed<br>
      All path of man or beast that passed that way.<br>
      One gate there only was, and that looked east<br>
      On the other side. Which when the Arch-Felon saw,<br>
      Due entrance he disdained, and, in contempt,<br>
      At one slight bound high overleaped all bound<br>
      Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within<br>
      Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf,<br>
      Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,<br>
      Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve,<br>
      In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,<br>
      Leaps o’er the fence with ease into the fold;<br>
      Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash<br>
      Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,<br>
      Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,<br>
      In at the window climbs, or o’er the tiles;<br>
      So climb this first grand Thief into God’s fold:<br>
      So since into his Church lewd hirelings climb.<br>
      Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,<br>
      The middle tree and highest there that grew,<br>
      Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true life<br>
      Thereby regained, but sat devising death<br>
      To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought<br>
      Of that life-giving plant, but only used<br>
      For prospect what, well used, had been the pledge<br>
      Of immortality. So little knows<br>
      Any, but God alone, to value right<br>
      The good before him, but perverts best things<br>
      To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.<br>
      Beneath him, with new wonder, now he views,<br>
      To all delight of human sense exposed,<br>
      In narrow room Nature’s whole wealth; yea, more—<br>
      A Heaven on Earth: for blissful Paradise<br>
      Of God the garden was, by him in the east<br>
      Of Eden planted. Eden stretched her line<br>
      From Auran eastward to the royal towers<br>
      Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,<br>
      Or where the sons of Eden long before<br>
      Dwelt in Telassar. In this pleasant soil<br>
      His far more pleasant garden God ordained.<br>
      Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow<br>
      All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;<br>
      And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,<br>
      High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit<br>
      Of vegetable gold; and next to life,<br>
      Our death, the Tree of Knowledge, grew fast by—<br>
      Knowledge of good, bought dear by knowing ill.<br>
      Southward through Eden went a river large,<br>
      Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill<br>
      Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown<br>
      That mountain, as his garden-mould, high raised<br>
      Upon the rapid current, which, through veins<br>
      Of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn,<br>
      Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill<br>
      Watered the garden; thence united fell<br>
      Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,<br>
      Which from his darksome passage now appears,<br>
      And now, divided into four main streams,<br>
      Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm<br>
      And country whereof here needs no account;<br>
      But rather to tell how, if Art could tell<br>
      How, from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,<br>
      Rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold,<br>
      With mazy error under pendant shades<br>
      Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br>
      Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art<br>
      In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon<br>
      Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,<br>
      Both where the morning sun first warmly smote<br>
      The open field, and where the unpierced shade<br>
      Imbrowned the noontide bowers. Thus was this place,<br>
      A happy rural seat of various view:<br>
      Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,<br>
      Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,<br>
      Hung amiable—Hesperian fables true,<br>
      If true, here only—and of delicious taste.<br>
      Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks<br>
      Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,<br>
      Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap<br>
      Of some irriguous valley spread her store,<br>
      Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose.<br>
      Another side, umbrageous grots and caves<br>
      Of cool recess, o’er which the mantling vine<br>
      Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps<br>
      Luxuriant; meanwhile murmuring waters fall<br>
      Down the slope hills dispersed, or in a lake,<br>
      That to the fringèd bank with myrtle crowned<br>
      Her crystal mirror holds, unite their streams.<br>
      The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,<br>
      Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune<br>
      The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,<br>
      Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,<br>
      Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field<br>
      Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flowers,<br>
      Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis<br>
      Was gathered—which cost Ceres all that pain<br>
      To seek her through the world—nor that sweet grove<br>
      Of Daphne, by Orontes and the inspired<br>
      Castalian spring, might with this Paradise<br>
      Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle,<br>
      Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,<br>
      Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,<br>
      Hid Amalthea, and her florid son,<br>
      Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea’s eye;<br>
      Nor, where Abassin kings their issue guard,<br>
      Mount Amara (though this by some supposed<br>
      True Paradise) under the Ethiop line<br>
      By Nilus’ head, enclosed with shining rock,<br>
      A whole day’s journey high, but wide remote<br>
      From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend<br>
      Saw undelighted all delight, all kind<br>
      Of living creatures, new to sight and strange.<br>
      Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,<br>
      God—like erect, with native honour clad<br>
      In naked majesty, seemed lords of all,<br>
      And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine<br>
      The image of their glorious Maker shon,<br>
      Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure—<br>
      Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,<br>
      Whence true authority in men: though both<br>
      Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;<br>
      For contemplation he and valour formed,<br>
      For softness she and sweet attractive grace;<br>
      He for God only, she for God in him.<br>
      His fair large front and eye sublime declared<br>
      Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin locks<br>
      Round from his parted forelock manly hung<br>
      Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:<br>
      She, as a veil down to the slender waist,<br>
      Her unadornèd golden tresses wore<br>
      Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved<br>
      As the vine curls her tendrils—which implied<br>
      Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br>
      And by her yielded, by him best received—<br>
      Yielded, with coy submission, modest pride,<br>
      And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.<br>
      Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed:<br>
      Then was not guilty shame. Dishonest shame<br>
      Of Nature’s works, honour dishonourable,<br>
      Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind<br>
      With shews instead, mere shews of seeming pure<br>
      And banished from man’s life his happiest life,<br>
      Simplicity and spotless innocence!<br>
      So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight<br>
      Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:<br>
      So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair<br>
      That ever since in love’s embraces met—<br>
      Adam the goodliest man of men since born<br>
      His sons; the fairest of her daughters Eve.<br>
      Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br>
      Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain—side.<br>
      They sat them down; and, after no more toil<br>
      Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed<br>
      To recommend cool Zephyr, and make ease<br>
      More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite<br>
      More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell—<br>
      Nectarine fruits, which the complaint boughs<br>
      Yielded them, sidelong as they sat recline<br>
      On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers.<br>
      The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,<br>
      Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream<br>
      Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles<br>
      Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems<br>
      Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league,<br>
      Alone as they. About them frisking played<br>
      All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase<br>
      In wood or wilderness, forest or den.<br>
      Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw<br>
      Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,<br>
      Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,<br>
      To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed<br>
      His lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly,<br>
      Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine<br>
      His breaded train, and of his fatal guile<br>
      Gave proof unheeded. Others on the grass<br>
      Couched, and, now filled with pasture, gazing sat,<br>
      Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,<br>
      Declined, was hastening now with prone career<br>
      To the Ocean Isles, and in the ascending scale<br>
      Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:<br>
      When Satan, still in gaze as first he stood,<br>
      Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold?<br>
      Into our room of bliss thus high advanced<br>
      Creatures of other mould—Earth-born perhaps,<br>
      Not Spirits, yet to Heavenly Spirits bright<br>
      Little inferior—whom my thoughts pursue<br>
      With wonder, and could love; so lively shines<br>
      In them divine resemblance, and such grace<br>
      The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.<br>
      Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh<br>
      Your change approaches, when all these delights<br>
      Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe—<br>
      More woe, the more your taste is now of joy:<br>
      Happy, but for so happy ill secured<br>
      Long to continue, and this high seat, your Heaven,<br>
      Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe<br>
      As now is entered; yet no purposed foe<br>
      To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,<br>
      Though I unpitied. League with you I seek,<br>
      And mutual amity, so strait, so close,<br>
      That I with you must dwell, or you with me,<br>
      Henceforth. My dwelling, haply, may not please,<br>

      Now other, as their shape served best his end<br>
      Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,<br>
