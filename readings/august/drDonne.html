          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne" target="_blank">John Donne</a> (22 January 1572 – 31 March 1631) was an English poet and cleric in the Church of England.
          He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons.
          <em>The Life of Dr. Donne</em> is a biography about John Donne written by Izaak Walton (c. 1593 – 15 December 1683), an English writer.

        <span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">e continued that employment for the space of five years</span>, being
daily useful, and not mercenary to his friend. During which time, he — I dare not say unhappily — fell into such a liking, as — with her
<span class="tooltip">approbation<span class="tooltiptext">approval or praise.</span></span> — increased into a love, with a young gentlewoman that lived in that family, who was niece to the Lady Ellesmere, and
daughter to Sir George More, then Chancellor of the <span class="tooltip">Garter<span class="tooltiptext">The Order of the Garter is an order of chivalry founded by King Edward III of England in 1348.</span></span> and
Lieutenant of the Tower.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sir George had some intimation of it, and, knowing prevention to be a great part of wisdom, did therefore remove her with much
haste from that to his own house at Lothesley, in the County of Surrey; but too late, by reason of some faithful promises which were
so interchangeably passed, as never to be violated by either party.
      </p>

      <p>
        These promises were only known to themselves; and the friends of both parties used much diligence, and many arguments, to kill or
cool their affections to each other: but in vain; for love is a flattering
mischief, that hath denied aged and wise men a foresight of those
evils that too often prove to be the children of that blind father; a passion, that carries us to commit errors with as much ease as whirlwinds move feathers, and begets in us an unwearied industry to the attainment of what we desire. And such an industry did, notwithstanding
much watchfulness against it, bring them secretly together, — I forbear to tell the manner how, — and at last to a marriage too, without the allowance of those friends, whose approbation always
was, and ever will be necessary, to make even a virtuous love become
lawful.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, that the knowledge of their marriage might not fall, like an unexpected tempest, on those that were unwilling to have it so; and
that pre-apprehensions might make it the less enormous when it was
known, it was purposely whispered into the ears of many that it was
so, yet by none that could affirm it. But, to put a period to the
jealousies of Sir George, — doubt often begetting more restless thoughts than the certain knowledge of what we fear, — the news
was, in favour to Mr. Donne, and with his allowance, made known
to Sir George by his honourable friend and neighbour, Henry, Earl
of Northumberland; but it was to Sir George so immeasurably
unwelcome, and so transported him, that, as though his passion of anger and inconsideration might exceed theirs of love and error, he presently engaged his sister, the Lady Ellesmere, to join with him
to procure her lord to discharge Mr. Donne of the place he held
under his Lordship. This request was followed with violence; and
though Sir George was remembered that errors might be over-punished, and desired therefore to forbear till second considerations
might clear some scruples, yet he became restless until his suit was
granted, and the punishment executed. And though the Lord Chancellor
did not, at Mr. Donne's dismission, give him such a commendation
as the great Emperor Charles the Fifth did of his Secretary
Eraso, when he parted with him to his son and successor, Philip
the Second, saying, "That in his Eraso, he gave to him a greater
gift than all his estate, and all the kingdoms which he then resigned
to him;" yet the Lord Chancellor said, "He parted with a friend,
and such a secretary as was fitter to serve a king than a subject."
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately after his dismission from his service he sent a sad
letter to his wife, to acquaint her with it; and after the subscription
of his name, writ,

        <blockquote>
          John Donne, Anne Donne, Un-done;
        </blockquote>

        And God knows it proved too true; for this bitter physic of Mr.
Donne's dismission was not enough to purge out all Sir George's
choler; for he was not satisfied till Mr. Donne and his sometime
com-pupil in Cambridge, that married him, namely, Samuel Brooke,
who was after Doctor in Divinity and Master of Trinity College,
and his brother, Mr. Christopher Brooke, sometime Mr, Donne's
chamber-fellow in Lincoln's Inn, who gave Mr. Donne his wife, and witnessed the marriage, were all committed to three several prisons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. Donne was first enlarged, who neither gave rest to his body
or brain, nor to any friend in whom he might hope to have an
interest, until he had procured an enlargement for his two imprisoned friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was now at liberty, but his days were still cloudy: and being
past these troubles, others did still multiply upon him; for his wife was — to her extreme sorrow — detained from him; and though with
Jacob he endured not a hard service for her, yet he lost a good one, and was forced to make good his title, and to get possession of her by a long and restless suit in law; which proved troublesome and
sadly chargeable to him, whose youth, and travel, and needless bounty had brought his estate into a narrow compass.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is observed, and most truly, that silence and submission are charming qualities, and work most upon passionate men; and it proved so with Sir George; for these, and a general report of Mr.
Donne's merits, together with his winning behaviour, which, when
it would entice, had a strange kind of elegant irresistible art; — these and time had so dispassionated Sir George, that as the world
approved his daughter's choice, so he also could not but see a more
than ordinary merit in his new son; and this at last melted him into so much remorse, — for love and anger are so like <span class="tooltip">agues<span class="tooltiptext">malaria or some other illness involving fever and shivering.</span></span>, as to have
hot and cold fits; and love in parents, though it may be quenched,
yet is easily re-kindled, and expires not till death denies mankind
a natural heat, — that he laboured his son's restoration to his place;
using to that end both his own and his sister's power to her lord;
but with no success, for his answer was, "That though he was unfeignedly
sorry for what he had done, yet it was inconsistent with his place and credit to discharge and re-admit servants at the request of passionate petitioners."
      </p>

      <p>
        Sir George's endeavour for Mr. Donne's re-admission was by all means to be kept secret: for men do more naturally reluct for errors than submit to put on those blemishes that attend their visible acknowledgment. — But, however, it was not long before Sir George
appeared to be so far reconciled as to wish their happiness, and not
to deny them his paternal blessing, but yet refused to contribute any means that might conduce to their livelihood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. Donne's estate was the greater part spent in many and chargeable
travels, books, and dear-bought experience; he out of all employment
that might yield a support for himself and wife, who had
been curiously and plentifully educated; both their natures generous,
and accustomed to confer, and not to receive, courtesies: these and
other considerations, but chiefly that his wife was to bear a part in
his sufferings, surrounded him with many sad thoughts, and some
apparent apprehensions of want.
      </p>

      <p>
        But his sorrows were lessened and his wants prevented by the
seasonable courtesy of their noble kinsman, Sir Francis Wolly, of
Pirford, in Surrey, who entreated them to a cohabitation with him,
where they remained with much freedom to themselves, and equal
content to him, for some years; and as their charge increased — she
had yearly a child — so did his love and bounty.
      </p>

      <p>
        It hath been observed by wise and considering men that wealth
hath seldom been the portion, and never the mark to discover good
people; but that Almighty God, who disposeth all things wisely,
hath of his abundant goodness denied it — He only knows why —
to many whose minds He hath enriched with the greater blessings
of knowledge and virtue, as the fairer testimonies of his love to mankind: and this was the present condition of this man of so
excellent erudition and endowments; whose necessary and daily
expenses were hardly reconcilable with his uncertain and narrow
estate. Which I mention, for that at this time there was a most
generous offer made him for the moderating of his worldly
cares; the declaration of which shall be the next employment of my
pen.
      </p>

      <p>
        God hath been so good to his church as to afford it in every age some such men to serve at his altar as have been piously ambitious of doing good to mankind; a disposition that is so like to God himself
that it owes itself only to Him, who takes a pleasure to behold it
in his creatures. These times He did bless with many such; some
of which still live to be patterns of apostolical charity, and of more
than human patience. I have said this because I have occasion to mention one of them in my following discourse, namely. Dr. Morton,
the most laborious and learned Bishop of Durham; one that God hath blessed with perfect intellectuals and a cheerful heart at the age of ninety-four years — and is yet living; — one that in his days of plenty had so large a heart as to use his large revenue to the encouragement of learning and virtue, and is now — be it spoken with sorrow — reduced to a narrow estate, which he embraces without <span class="tooltip">repining<span class="tooltiptext">feel or express discontent; fret.</span></span>;
and still shows the beauty of his mind by so liberal a hand,
as if this were an age in which tomorrow were to care for itself.
I have taken a pleasure in giving the reader a short but true character
of this good man, my friend, from whom I received this following relation. — He sent to Mr. Donne, and entreated to borrow an hour of his time for a conference the next day. After their meeting there was not many minutes passed before he spake to Mr. Donne to this purpose: "Mr. Donne, the occasion of sending
for you is to propose to you what I have often revolved in my own
thought since I last saw you: which, nevertheless, I will not declare but upon this condition, that you shall not return me a present answer, but forbear three days, and bestow some part of that time in fasting and prayer; and after a serious consideration of what I
shall propose, then return to me with your answer. Deny me not,
Mr. Donne; for it is the effect of a true love, which I would gladly
pay as a debt due for yours to me."
      </p>

      <p>
        This request being granted, the Doctor expressed himself thus: -
      </p>

      <p>
        "Mr. Donne, I know your education and abilities; I know your
expectation of a State employment; and I know your fitness for it; and I know, too, the many delays and contingencies that attend Court promises: and let me tell you that my love, begot by our long
friendship and your merits, hath prompted me to such an inquisition after your present temporal estate as makes me no stranger to your necessities, which I know to be such as your generous spirit
could not bear if it were not supported with a pious patience. You
know I have formerly persuaded you to waive your Court hopes,
and enter into holy orders; which I now again persuade you to embrace, with this reason added to my former request: The King
hath yesterday made me Dean of Gloucester, and I am also possessed of a benefice, the profits of which are equal to those of my deanery;
I will think my deanery enough for my maintenance, — who am, and
resolved to die, a single man, — and will quit my benefice, and estate you in it, which the patron is willing I shall do, if God shall incline your heart to embrace this motion. Remember, Mr. Donne, no
man's education or parts make him too good for this employment,
which is to be an ambassador for the God of glory; that God who
by a vile death opened the gates of life to mankind. Make me no
present answer; but remember your promise, and return to me the
third day with your resolution."
      </p>

      <p>
        At the hearing of this, Mr. Donne's faint breath and perplexed
countenance give a visible testimony of an inward conflict; but he performed his promise, and departed without returning an answer
till the third day, and then his answer was to this effect: -
      </p>

      <p>
        "My most worthy and most dear friend, since I saw you I have
been faithful to my promise, and have also meditated much of your
great kindness, which hath been such as would exceed even my
gratitude; but that it cannot do; and more I cannot return you; and
I do that with an heart full of humility and thanks, though I may
not accept of your offer: but, sir, my refusal is not for that I think
myself too good for that calling, for which kings, if they think so, are not good enough; nor for that my education and learning, though
not eminent, may not, being assisted with God's grace and humility,
render me in some measure fit for it : but I dare make so dear a friend
as you are my confessor. Some irregularities of my life have been so
visible to some men, that though I have, I thank God, made my
peace with Him by <span class="tooltip">penitential<span class="tooltiptext">relating to or expressing penance, voluntary self-punishment inflicted as an outward expression of repentance for having done wrong.</span></span> resolutions against them, and by the
assistance of his grace banished them my affections; yet this, which
God knows to be so, is not so visible to man as to free me from
their censures, and it may be that sacred calling from a dishonour.
And besides, whereas it is determined by the best of <span class="tooltip">casuists<span class="tooltiptext">a person who uses clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions; a sophist.</span></span> that God's glory should be the first end, and a maintenance the second
motive to embrace that calling, and though each man may propose
to himself both together, yet the first may not be put last without a
violation of conscience, which he that searches the heart will judge.
And truly my present condition is such that if I ask my own conscience
whether it be reconcilable to that rule, it is at this time so perplexed about it, that I can neither give myself nor you an answer. You know, sir, who says, 'Happy is that man whose conscience doth
not accuse him for that thing which he does.' To these I might add other reasons that dissuade me; but I crave your favour that I may forbear to express them, and thankfully decline your offer."
      </p>

      <p>
        This was his present resolution, but the heart of man is not in his own keeping; and he was destined to this sacred service by an
higher hand — a hand so powerful as at last forced him to a compliance: of which I shall give the reader an account before I shall give a rest to my pen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mr. Donne and his wife continued with Sir Francis Wolly till his death: a little before which time Sir Francis was so happy as to make
a perfect reconciliation betwixt Sir George and his forsaken son and
daughter; Sir George conditioning by bond to pay to Mr. Donne
￡800 at a certain day, as a portion with his wife, or ￡20 quarterly
for their maintenance as the interest for it, till the said portion was
paid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of those years that he lived with Sir Francis he studied the
Civil and Canon Laws; in which he acquired such a perfection, as was judged to hold proportion with many who had made that study
the employment of their whole life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sir Francis being dead, and that happy family dissolved, Mr.
Donne took for himself a house in Mitcham, near to Croydon in Surrey, a place noted for good air and choice company; there his wife and children remained; and for himself he took lodgings in London, near to Whitehall, whither his friends and occasions drew
him very often, and where he was as often visited by many of the
nobility and others of this nation, who used him in their counsels of greatest consideration, and with some rewards for his better subsistence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor did our own nobility only value and favour him, but his acquaintance and friendship was sought for by most ambassadors
of foreign nations, and by many other strangers, whose learning or
business occasioned their stay in this nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was much importuned by many friends to make his constant residence in London; but he still denied it, having settled his dear
wife and children at Mitcham, and near some friends that were
bountiful to them and him; for they, God knows, needed it: and
that you may the better now judge of the then present condition of his mind and fortune, I shall present you with an extract collected out of some few of his many letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        ". . . And the reason why I did not send an answer to your last week's letter was, because it then found me under too great a sadness;
and at present 'tis thus with me: There is not one person, but
myself, well of my family: I have already lost half a child, and, with
that mischance of hers, my wife has fallen into such a discomposure
as would afflict her too extremely, but that the sickness of all her
other children stupefies her — of one of which, in good faith, I have
not much hope; and these meet with a fortune so ill-provided for
physic, and such relief, that if God should ease us with burials, I know not how to perform even that: but I flatter myself with this hope, that I am dying too; for I cannot waste faster than by such
griefs. As for, -

        <blockquote>
          From my Hospital at Mitcham, John Donne, Aug. 10"
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus he did bemoan himself; and thus in other letters -
      </p>

      <p>
        ". . . For, we hardly discover a sin, when it is but an omission of some good, and no accusing act: with this or the former I have
often suspected myself to be overtaken; which is, with an overearnest
desire of the next life: and, though I know it is not merely
a weariness of this, because I had the same desire when I went with
the tide, and enjoyed fairer hopes than I now do; yet I doubt worldly
troubles have increased it: 'tis now spring, and all the pleasures of
it displease me; every other tree blossoms, and I wither; I grow older,
and not better; my strength diminisheth, and my load grows heavier;
and yet I would fain be or do something; but that I cannot tell what, is no wonder in this time of my sadness; for to choose is to do: but to be no part of any body is as to be nothing: and so I am,
and shall so judge myself, unless I could be so incorporated into a
part of the world, as by business to contribute some sustentation
to the whole. This I made account: I began early, when I understood
the study of our laws; but was diverted by leaving that, and
embracing the worst voluptuousness, an <span class="tooltip">hydroptic<span class="tooltiptext">Insatiably thirsty</span></span> immoderate desire of human learning and languages; beautiful ornaments indeed
to men of great fortunes, but mine was grown so low as to need an
occupation; which I thought I entered well into, when I subjected
myself to such a service as I thought might exercise my poor abilities: and there I stumbled, and fell too; and now I am become so little, or such a nothing, that I am not a subject good enough for one of my own letters. — Sir, I fear my present discontent does not proceed
from a good root, that I am so well content to be nothing, that is, dead. But, sir, though my fortune hath made me such, as that I am
rather a sickness or a disease of the world, than any part of it, and
therefore neither love it nor life, yet I would gladly live to become some such thing as you should not repent loving me. Sir, your own
soul cannot be more zealous for your good than I am; and God,
who loves that zeal in me, will not suffer you to doubt it. You would
pity me now if you saw me write, for my pain hath drawn my head
so much awry, and holds it so, that my eye cannot follow my pen.
I therefore receive you into my prayers with mine own weary soul,
and commend myself to yours. I doubt not but next week will bring
you good news, for I have either mending or dying on my side; but
if I do continue longer thus, I shall have comfort in this, that my
blessed Saviour in exercising his justice upon my two worldly parts,
my fortune and my body, reserves all his mercy for that which most
needs it, my soul! which is, I doubt, too like a porter, that is very often near the gate, and yet goes not out. Sir, I profess to you truly that my loathness to give over writing now seems to myself a sign
that I shall write no more.
