        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus" target="_blank">Epictetus</a>
           (c. 55 – 135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born a slave at Hierapolis,
           Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment,
           when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life.
           His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his
           <em>Discourses</em> and <em>Enchiridion</em>.
          Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a
          theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are beyond
          our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens.
          However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they
          can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline.

      <h3>CLXVIII</h3>
      <p>
        Take what relates to the body as far as the bare use warrants — as meat, drink, <span class="tooltip">raiment<span class="tooltiptext">clothing.</span></span>, house and servants. But all that makes for show and luxury reject.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXIX</h3>
      <p>
        If you are told that such an one speaks ill of you, make no defence
against what was said, but answer. He surely knew not my other
faults, else he would not have mentioned these only!
      </p>

      <h3>CLXX</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit any of those in power, bethink yourself that you
will not find him in: that you may not be admitted: that the door
may be shut in your face: that he may not concern himself about
you. If with all this, it is your duty to go, bear what happens, and
never say to yourself. It was not worth the trouble! For that would
smack of the foolish and unlearned who suffer outward things to touch them.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXI</h3>
      <p>
        In company avoid frequent and undue talk about your own actions and dangers. However pleasant it may be to you to enlarge upon
the risks you have run, others may not find such pleasure in listening to your adventures. Avoid provoking laughter also: it is a habit from which one easily slides into the ways of the foolish, and
apt to diminish the respect which your neighbours feel for you. To
border on coarse talk is also dangerous. On such occasions, if a convenient opportunity offer, rebuke the speaker. If not, at least by
relapsing into silence, colouring, and looking annoyed, show that you are displeased with the subject.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXII</h3>
      <p>
        When you have decided that a thing ought to be done, and are doing it, never shun being seen doing it, even though the multitude
should be likely to judge the matter amiss. For if you are not acting
rightly, shun the act itself; if rightly, however, why fear misplaced
<span class="tooltip">censure<span class="tooltiptext">the expression of formal disapproval.</span></span>?
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXIII</h3>
      <p>
        It stamps a man of mean capacity to spend much time on the things
of the body, as to be long over bodily exercises, long over eating,
long over drinking, long over other bodily functions. Rather should
these things take the second place, while all your care is directed to the understanding.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXIV</h3>
      <p>
        Everything has two handles, one by which it may be borne, the
other by which it may not. If your brother sin against you lay not hold of it by the handle of his injustice, for by that it may not be
borne: but rather by this, that he is your brother, the comrade of your
youth; and thus you will lay hold on it so that it may be borne.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXV</h3>
      <p>
        Never call yourself a Philosopher nor talk much among the unlearned
about Principles, but do that which follows from them. Thus
at a banquet, do not discuss how people ought to eat; but eat as you ought. Remember that Socrates thus entirely avoided ostentation.
Men would come to him desiring to be recommended to philosophers,
and he would conduct them thither himself — so well did
he bear being overlooked. Accordingly if any talk concerning principles
should arise among the unlearned, be you for the most part
silent. For you run great risk of spewing up what you have ill
digested. And when a man tells you that you know nothing and you
are not <span class="tooltip">nettled<span class="tooltiptext">irritated or annoyed</span></span> at it, then you may be sure that you have begun the work.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXVI</h3>
      <p>
        When you have brought yourself to supply the needs of the body
at small cost, do not pique yourself on that, nor if you drink only
water, keep saying on each occasion, I drink water! And if you ever want to practise endurance and toil, do so unto yourself and not unto
others — do not embrace statues!
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXVII</h3>
      <p>
        When a man prides himself on being able to understand and
interpret the writigs of <span class="tooltip">Chrysippus<span class="tooltiptext">Chrysippus of Soli was a Greek Stoic philosopher.</span></span>, say to yourself:
      </p>

      <p>
        If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this fellow would have
had nothing to be proud of. But what is it that I desire? To understand
Nature, and to follow her! Accordingly I ask who is the Interpreter.
On hearing that it is Chrysippus, I go to him. But it seems
I do not understand what he wrote. So I seek one to interpret that. So far there is nothing to pride myself upon. But when I have
found my interpreter, what remains is to put in practice his instructions.
This itself is the only thing to be proud of. But if I admire
the interpretation and that alone, what else have I turned out but
a mere commentator instead of a lover of wisdom? — except indeed
that I happen to be interpreting Chrysippus instead of Homer. So
when any one says to me, Prithee, read me Chrysippus, I am more
inclined to blush, when I cannot show my deeds to be in harmony
and accordance with his sayings.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXVIII</h3>
      <p>
        At feasts, remember that you are entertaining two guests, body and
soul. What you give to the body, you presently lose; what you give
to the soul, you keep for ever.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXIX</h3>
      <p>
        At meals see to it that those who serve be not more in number
than those who are served. It is absurd for a crowd of persons to be
dancing attendance on half a dozen chairs.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXX</h3>
      <p>
        It is best to share with your attendants what is going forward,
both in the labour of preparation and in the enjoyment of the feast
itself. If such a thing be difficult at the time, recollect that you who
are not weary are being served by those that are; you who are eating
and drinking by those who do neither; you who are talking by those who are silent; you who are at ease by those who are under constraint. Thus no sudden wrath will betray you into unreasonable conduct,
nor will you behave harshly by irritating another.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXI</h3>
      <p>
        When <span class="tooltip">Xanthippe<span class="tooltiptext">Xanthippe was an ancient Athenian, the wife of Socrates and mother of their three sons</span></span> was chiding Socrates for making scanty preparation
for entertaining his friends, he answered: — "If they are
friends of ours, they will not care for that; if they are not, we
shall care nothing for them!"
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXII</h3>
      <p>
        Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, "He who is content."
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXIII</h3>
      <p>
        Favorinus tells us how Epictetus would also say that there were two faults far graver and fouler than any others — inability to bear,
and inability to forbear, when we neither patiently bear the blows
that must be borne, nor abstain from the things and the pleasures we ought to abstain from. "So," he went on, "if a man will only
have these two words at heart, and heed them carefully by ruling
and watching over himself, he will for the most part fall into no
sin, and his life will be tranquil and serene." He meant the words "Bear and Forbear."
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXIV</h3>
      <p>
        On all occasions these thoughts should be at hand: —
        <blockquote>
          Lead me, O God, and Thou, O Destiny, <br>
          Be what it may the goal appointed me, <br>
          Bravely I'll follow; nay, and if I would not, <br>
          I'd prove a coward, yet must follow still!
        </blockquote>
        Again:
        <blockquote>
          Who to Necessity doth bow aright, <br>
          Is learn'd in wisdom and the things of God.
        </blockquote>
        Once more: -
        <blockquote>
          Crito, if this be God's will, so let it be. As for me, Anytus and Meletus
can indeed put me to death, but injure me, never!
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXV</h3>
      <p>
        We shall then be like Socrates, when we can indite hymns of
praise to the Gods in prison.
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXVI</h3>
      <p>
        It is hard to combine and unite these two qualities, the carefulness of one who is affected by circumstances, and the intrepidity of one who heeds them not. But it is not impossible: else were happiness
also impossible. We should act as we do in seafaring.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What can I do?" — Choose the master, the crew, the day, the opportunity. Then comes a sudden storm. What matters it to me? my part has been fully done. The matter is in the hands of another —
the Master of the ship. The ship is foundering. What then have I to do? I do the only thing that remains to me — to be drowned without fear, without a cry, without upbraiding God, but knowing that what has been born must likewise perish. For I am not Eternity,
but a human being — a part of the whole, as an hour is part of the day. I must come like the hour, and like the hour must pass!
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXVII</h3>
      <p>
        And now we are sending you to Rome to spy out the land; but none send a coward as such a spy, that, if he hear but a noise and
see a shadow moving anywhere, loses his wits and comes flying to
say. The enemy are upon us!
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you go now, and come and tell us: "Everything at Rome is terrible: Death is terrible, Exile is terrible, Slander is terrible. Want
is terrible; fly, comrades! the enemy are upon us!" we shall reply,
Get you gone, and prophesy to yourself! we have but erred in sending such a spy as you. <span class="tooltip">Diogenes<span class="tooltiptext">Diogenes, also known as Diogenes the Cynic, was a Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynic philosophy.</span></span>, who was sent as a spy long before you, brought us back another report than this. He says that Death
is no evil; for it need not even bring shame with it. He says that Fame is but the empty noise of madmen. And what report did this spy bring us of Pain, what of Pleasure, what of Want? That to be
clothed in sackcloth is better than any purple robe; that sleeping on
the bare ground is the softest couch; and in proof of each assertion he
points to his own courage, constancy, and freedom; to his own healthy and muscular frame. "There is no enemy near," he cries,
"all is perfect peace!"
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXVIII</h3>
      <p>
        If a man has this peace — not the peace proclaimed by Caesar (how
indeed should he have it to proclaim?), nay, but the peace proclaimed
by God through reason, will not that suffice him when alone, when
he beholds and reflects: — Now can no evil happen unto me; for me
there is no robber, for me no earthquake; all things are full of peace,
full of tranquillity; neither highway nor city nor gathering of men,
neither neighbour nor comrade can do me hurt. Another supplies
my food, whose care it is; another my raiment; another hath given
me perceptions of sense and primary conceptions. And when He supplies
my necessities no more, it is that He is sounding the retreat, that He hath opened the door, and is saying to thee. Come! — Whither?
To nought that thou needest fear, but to the friendly kindred elements whence thou didst spring. Whatsoever of fire is in thee, unto
fire shall return; whatsoever of earth, unto earth; of spirit, unto spirit;
of water, unto water. There is no Hades, no fabled rivers of Sighs,
of Lamentation, or of Fire: but all things are full of Beings spiritual
and divine. With thoughts like these, beholding the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, enjoying earth and sea, a man is neither helpless nor alone!
      </p>

      <h3>CLXXXIX</h3>
      <p>
        What wouldst thou be found doing when overtaken by Death?
If I might choose, I would be found doing some deed of true humanity,
of wide import, beneficent and noble. But if I may not be found
engaged in aught so lofty, let me hope at least for this — what none may hinder, what is surely in my power — that I may be found raising up in myself that which had fallen; learning to deal more wisely
with the things of sense; working out my own tranquillity, and
thus rendering that which is its due to every relation of life. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        If death surprise me thus employed, it is enough if I can stretch forth my hands to God and say, "The faculties which I received at Thy hands for apprehending this thine Administration, I have not
neglected. As far as in me lay, I have done Thee no dishonour. Behold how I have used the senses, the primary conceptions which Thou gavest me. Have I ever laid anything to Thy charge? Have
I ever murmured at aught that came to pass, or wished it otherwise?
Have I in anything transgressed the relations of life? For that Thou
didst beget me, I thank Thee for that Thou hast given: for the time
during which I have used the things that were Thine, it suffices me. Take them back and place them wherever Thou wilt! They were
all Thine, and Thou gavest them me." — If a man depart thus minded,
is it not enough? What life is fairer or more noble, what end happier
than his?
