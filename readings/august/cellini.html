      <h3>XXXIII</h3>

      <p>
        <span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="smallcaps">had but just dismounted from my horse</span>, when one of those
excellent people who rejoice in mischief-making came to tell me that Pagolo Micceri had taken a house for the little hussy Caterina and
her mother, and that he was always going there, and whenever he
mentioned me, used words of scorn to this effect: "Benvenuto set the fox to watch the grapes,' and thought I would not eat them! Now
he is satisfied with going about and talking big, and thinks I am
afraid of him. But I have girt this sword and dagger to my side in order to show him that my steel can cut as well as his, and that I too am a Florentine, of the Micceri, a far better family than his Cellini." The scoundrel who reported this poisonous gossip spoke it with such good effect that I felt a fever in the instant swoop upon
me; and when I say fever, I mean fever, and no mere metaphor.
The insane passion which took possession of me might have been my
death, had I not resolved to give it vent as the occasion offered. I ordered the Ferrarese workman, Chioccia, to come with me, and
made a servant follow with my horse. When we reached the house
where that worthless villain was, I found the door ajar, and entered.
I noticed that he carried sword and dagger, and was sitting on a
big chest with his arm round Caterina's neck; at the moment of my
arrival, I could hear that he and her mother were talking about me.
Pushing the door open, I drew my sword, and set the point of it at
his throat, not giving him the time to think whether he too carried
steel. At the same instant I cried out: "Vile coward! recommend
your soul to God, for you are a dead man." Without budging from
his seat, he called three times: "Mother, mother, help me!" Though
I had come there fully determined to take his life, half my fury
ebbed away when I heard this idiotic exclamation. I ought to add
that I had told Chioccia not to let the girl or her mother leave the
house, since I meant to deal with those trollops after I had disposed
of their bully. So I went on holding my sword at his throat, and now and then just pricked him with the point, pouring out a
torrent of terrific threats at the same time. But when I found he
did not stir a finger in his own defence, I began to wonder what I should do next; my menacing attitude could not be kept up for ever;
so at last it came into my head to make them marry, and complete
my vengeance at a later period. Accordingly, I formed my resolution,
and began: "Take that ring, coward, from your finger, and marry
her, that I may get satisfaction from you afterwards according to your deserts." He replied at once: "If only you do not kill me, I will do whatever you command." "Then," said I, "put that ring upon
her hand." When the sword's point was withdrawn a few inches
from his throat, he wedded her with the ring. But I added: "This is not enough. I shall send for two notaries, in order that the marriage
may be ratified by contract." Bidding Chioccia go for the lawyers,
I turned to the girl and her mother, and, using the French language,
spoke as follows: "Notaries and witnesses are coming; the first of you who blabs about this affair will be killed upon the spot; nay, I will murder you all three. So beware, and keep a quiet tongue in your heads." To him I said in Italian : "If you offer any resistance to what I shall propose, upon the slightest word you utter I will stab you till your guts run out upon this floor." He answered: "Only
promise not to kill me, and I will do whatever you command." The
notaries and witnesses arrived; a contract, valid and in due form, was drawn up; then my heat and fever left me. I paid the lawyers
and took my departure.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the following day Bologna came to Paris on purpose, and sent for me through Mattio del Nasaro. I went to see him; and he met
me with a glad face, entreating me to regard him as a brother, and
saying that he would never speak about that work again, since he
recognised quite well that I was right.
      </p>

      <h3>XXXIV</h3>

      <p>
        If I did not confess that in some of these episodes I acted wrongly,
the world might think I was not telling the truth about those in which I say I acted rightly. Therefore I admit that it was a mistake
to inflict so singular a vengeance upon Pagolo Micceri. In truth,
had I believed him to be so utterly feeble, I should not have conceived the notion of branding him with such infamy as I am going
to relate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not satisfied with having made him take a vicious drab to wife,
I completed my revenge by inviting her to sit to me as a model, and
dealing with her thus. I gave her thirty sous a day, paid in advance,
and a good meal, and obliged her to pose before me naked. Then I made her serve my pleasure, out of spite against her husband, jeering
at them both the while. Furthermore, I kept her for hours together in position, greatly to her discomfort. This gave her as much annoyance as it gave me pleasure; for she was beautifully made, and
brought me much credit as a model. At last, noticing that I did not
treat her with the same consideration as before her marriage, she began to grumble and talk big in her French way about her husband,
who was now serving the Prior of Capua, a brother of Piero Strozzi. On the first occasion when she did this, the mere mention of the
fellow aroused me to intolerable fury; still I bore it, greatly against
the grain, as well as I was able, reflecting that I could hardly find
so suitable a subject for my art as she was. So I reasoned thus in my
own mind: "I am now taking two different kinds of revenge. In
the first place, she is married; and what I am doing to her husband
is something far more serious than what he did to me, when she was only a girl of loose life. If then I wreak my spite so fully upon
him, while upon her I inflict the discomfort of posing in such strange
attitudes for such a length of time — which, beside the pleasure I
derive, brings me both profit and credit through my art — what more
can I desire?" While I was turning over these calculations, the wretch redoubled her insulting speeches, always prating big about
her husband, till she goaded me beyond the bounds of reason. Yielding myself up to blind rage, I seized her by the hair, and
dragged her up and down my room, beating and kicking her till I was tired. There was no one who could come to her assistance. When I had well pounded her she swore that she would never
visit me again. Then for the first time I perceived that I had acted very wrongly; for I was losing a grand model, who brought me
honour through my art. Moreover, when I saw her body all torn and bruised and swollen, I reflected that, even if I persuaded her to return, I should have to put her under medical treatment for at
least a fortnight before I could make use of her.
      </p>

      <h3>XXXV</h3>

      <p>
        Well, to return to Caterina. I sent my old serving-woman, named
Ruberta, who had a most kindly disposition, to help her dress. She
brought food and drink to the miserable baggage; and after rubbing
a little bacon fat into her worst wounds, they ate what was left of
the meat together. When she had finished dressing, she went off blaspheming and cursing all Italians in the King's service, and so returned with tears and murmurs to her home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assuredly, upon that first occasion, I felt I had done very wrong,
and Ruberta rebuked me after this fashion: "You are a cruel monster to maltreat such a handsome girl so brutally." When I excused my conduct by narrating all the tricks which she and her mother had played off upon me under my own roof, Ruberta scoldingly replied that that was nothing — that was only French manners, and she was sure there was not a husband in France without his horns. When I heard this argument, I laughed aloud, and then told Ruberta to go and see how Caterina was, since I should like to employ her again while finishing the work I had on hand. The old woman took me sharply up, saying that I had no savoir vivre: "Only
wait till daybreak, and she will come of herself; whereas, if you
send to ask after her or visit her, she will give herself airs and keep
away."
      </p>

      <p>
        On the following morning Caterina came to our door, and knocked
so violently, that, being below, I ran to see whether it was a madman
or some member of the household. When I opened, the creature laughed and fell upon my neck, embracing and kissing me, and
asked me if I was still angry with her. I said, "No!" Then she added: "Let me have something good to break my fast on." So I supplied her well with food, and partook of it at the same table in sign of reconciliation. Afterwards I began to model from her, during
which occurred some amorous diversions; and at last, just at the same hour as on the previous day, she irritated me to such a pitch
that I gave her the same drubbing. So we went on several days,
repeating the old round like clockwork. There was little or no
variation in the incidents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, I completed my work in a style which did me the
greatest credit. Next I set about to cast it in bronze. This entailed some difficulties, to relate which would be interesting from the point
of view of art; but since the whole history would occupy too much
space, I must omit it. Suffice it to say, that the figure came out
splendidly, and was as fine a specimen of foundry as had ever been
seen.
      </p>

      <h3>XXXVI</h3>

      <p>
        While this work was going forward, I set aside certain hours of the day for the salt-cellar, and certain others for the Jupiter. There were more men engaged upon the former than I had at my disposal for the latter, so the salt-cellar was by this time completely finished. The King had now returned to Paris; and when I paid him my respects,
I took the piece with me. As I have already related, it was oval in form, standing about two-thirds of a cubit, wrought of solid gold,
and worked entirely with the chisel. While speaking of the model,
I said before how I had represented Sea and Earth, seated, with their
legs interlaced, as we observe in the case of firths and promontories;
this attitude was therefore metaphorically appropriate. The Sea
carried a trident in his right hand, and in his left I put a ship of
delicate workmanship to hold the salt. Below him were his four
sea-horses, fashioned like our horses from the head to the front
hoofs; all the rest of their body, from the middle backwards, resembled
a fish, and the tails of these creatures were agreeably interwoven. Above this group the Sea sat throned in an attitude of pride
and dignity; around him were many kinds of fishes and other creatures of the ocean. The water was represented with its waves, and
enamelled in the appropriate colour. I had portrayed Earth under the form of a very handsome woman, holding her horn of plenty, entirely
nude like the male figure; in her left hand I placed a little temple
of Ionic architecture, most delicately wrought, which was meant to contain the pepper. Beneath her were the handsomest living creatures
which the earth produces; and the rocks were pardy enamelled,
partly left in gold. The whole piece reposed upon a base of ebony,
properly proportioned, but with a projecting cornice, upon which I introduced four golden figures in rather more than half-relief. They
represented Night, Day, Twilight, and Dawn. I put, moreover, into the same frieze four other figures, similar in size, and intended for the four chief winds; these were executed, and in part enamelled,
with the most exquisite refinement.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I exhibited this piece to his Majesty, he uttered a loud
outcry of astonishment, and could not satiate his eyes with gazing
at it. Then he bade me take it back to my house, saying he would
tell me at the proper time what I should have to do with it. So I carried it home, and sent at once to invite several of my best friends; we dined gaily together, placing the salt-cellar in the middle of the
table, and thus we were the first to use it. After this, I went on working at my Jupiter in silver, and also at the great vase I have
already described, which was richly decorated with a variety of ornaments and figures.
      </p>

      <h3>XXXVII</h3>

      <p>
        At that time Bologna, the painter, suggested to the King that it would be well if his Majesty sent him to Rome, with letters of recommendation, to the end that he might cast the foremost masterpieces
of antiquity, namely, the Laocoon, the Cleopatra, the Venus,
the Commodus, the Zingara, and the Apollo. These, of a truth, are by far the finest things in Rome. He told the King that when his Majesty had once set eyes upon those marvellous works, he would
then, and not till then, be able to criticise the arts of design, since everything which he had seen by us moderns was far removed from
the perfection of the ancients. The King accepted his proposal, and
gave him the introductions he required. Accordingly that beast went off, and took his bad luck with him. Not having the force and
courage to contend with his own hands against me, he adopted the
truly Lombard device of depreciating my performances by becoming
a copyist of antiques. In its own proper place I shall relate how,
though he had these statues excellently cast, he obtained a result quite contrary to his imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had now done for ever with that disreputable Caterina, and the
unfortunate young man, her husband, had decamped from Paris. Wanting then to finish off my Fontainebleau, which was already
cast in bronze, as well as to execute the two Victories which were
going to fill the angles above the lunette of the door, I engaged a poor girl of the age of about fifteen. She was beautifully made and
of a brunette complexion. Being somewhat savage in her ways and
spare of speech, quick in movement, with a look of sullenness about
her eyes, I nicknamed her Scorzone; her real name was Jeanne.
      </p>

      <p>
        With her for model, I gave perfect finish to the bronze Fontainebleau,
and also to the two Victories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now this girl was a clean maid, and I got her with child. She
gave birth to a daughter on the 7th of June, at thirteen hours of the day, in 1544, when I had exactly reached the age of forty-four. I named the infant Costanza; and M. Guido Guidi, the King's physician,
and my most intimate friend, as I have previously related,
held her at the font. He was the only godfather; for it is customary
in France to have but one godfather and two godmothers. One of
the latter was Madame Maddalena, wife to M. Luigi Alamanni, a gentleman of Florence and an accomplished poet. The other was
the wife of M. Ricciardo del Bene, our Florentine burgher, and a
great merchant in Paris; she was herself a French lady of distinguished family. This was the first child I ever had, so far as I remember. I settled money enough upon the girl for dowry to satisfy an aunt of hers, under whose tutelage I placed her, and from that time forwards I had nothing more to do with her.
      </p>

      <h3>XXXVIII</h3>

      <p>
        By labouring incessantly I had now got my various works well
forward; the Jupiter was nearly finished, and the vase also; the door
began to reveal its beauties. At that time the King came to Paris;
and though I gave the right date of the year 1544 for my daughter's
birth, we were still in 1543; but an opportunity of mentioning my
daughter having arisen, I availed myself of it, so as not to interrupt
the narrative of more important things. Well, the King, as I have
said, came to Paris, and paid me a visit soon after his arrival. The
magnificent show of works brought well-nigh to completion was
enough to satisfy anybody's eye; and indeed it gave that glorious
monarch no less contentment than the artist who had worked so hard upon them desired. While inspecting these things, it came
into his head that the Cardinal of Ferrara had fulfilled none of his promises to me, either as regarded a pension or anything else. Whispering
with his Admiral, he said that the Cardinal of Ferrara had
behaved very badly in the matter; and that he intended to make it up
to me himself, because he saw I was a man of few words, who in the twinkling of an eye might decamp without complaining or asking leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        On returning home, his Majesty, after dinner, told the Cardinal to give orders to his treasurer of the Exchequer that he should pay me
at an early date seven thousand crowns of gold, in three or four
instalments, according to his own convenience, provided only that he executed the commission faithfully. At the same time he repeated
words to this effect: "I gave Benvenuto into your charge, and you
have forgotten all about him." The Cardinal said that he would
punctually perform his Majesty's commands; but his own bad nature made him wait till the King's fit of generosity was over. Meanwhile
wars and rumours of wars were on the increase; it was the moment
when the Emperor with a huge army was marching upon Paris. Seeing the realm of France to be in great need of money, the Cardinal
one day began to talk of me, and said: "Sacred Majesty, acting
for the best, I have not had that money given to Benvenuto. First,
it is sorely wanted now for public uses. Secondly, so great a donation
would have exposed you to the risk of losing Benvenuto altogether; for if he found himself a rich man, he might have invested
his money in Italy, and the moment some caprice took hold of him,
he would have decamped without hesitation. I therefore consider
that your Majesty's best course will be to present him with something
in your kingdom, if you want to keep him in your service for any
length of time." The King, being really in want of money, approved
of these arguments; nevertheless, like the noble soul he was, and
truly worthy of his royal station, he judged rightly that the Cardinal
had acted thus in order to curry favour rather than from any clear prevision of distressed finances in so vast a realm.
      </p>

      <h3>XXXIX</h3>
      <p>
        As I have just said, his Majesty affected to concur with the Cardinal,
but his own private mind was otherwise made up. Accordingly,
upon the day after his arrival, without solicitation upon my
part, he came of his own accord to my house. I went to meet him,
and conducted him through several rooms where divers works of art were on view. Beginning with the less important, I pointed out
a quantity of things in bronze; and it was long since he had seen
so many at once. Then I took him to see the Jupiter in silver, now
nearly completed, with all its splendid decorations. It so happened
that a grievous disappointment which he had suffered a few years
earlier, made him think this piece more admirable than it might
perhaps have appeared to any other man. The occasion to which I
refer was this: After the capture of Tunis, the Emperor passed
through Paris with the consent of his brother-in-law. King Francis,
who wanted to present him with something worthy of so great a
potentate. Having this in view, he ordered a Hercules to be executed
in silver, exactly of the same size as my Jupiter. The King declared
this Hercules to be the ugliest work of art that he had ever seen, and spoke his opinion plainly to the craftsmen of Paris. They
vaunted themselves to be the ablest craftsmen in the world for works
of this kind, and informed the King that nothing more perfect could
possibly have been produced in silver, insisting at the same time
upon being paid two thousand ducats for their filthy piece of work.
This made the King, when he beheld mine, affirm that the finish of
its workmanship exceeded his highest expectations. Accordingly he
made an equitable judgment, and had my statue valued also at two
thousand ducats, saying: "I gave those other men no salary; Cellini,
who gets about a thousand crowns a year from me, can surely let me have this masterpiece for two thousand crowns of gold, since he has his salary into the bargain." Then I exhibited other things in gold and silver, and a variety of models for new undertakings. At
the last, just when he was taking leave, I pointed out upon the lawn
of the castle that great giant, which roused him to higher astonishment than any of the other things he had inspected. Turning to
his Admiral, who was called Monsignor Aniballe, he said: "Since
the Cardinal has made him no provision, we must do so, and all the more because the man himself is so slow at asking favours — to cut it
short, I mean to have him well provided for; yes, these men who ask
for nothing feel that their masterpieces call aloud for recompense; therefore see that he gets the first abbey that falls vacant worth two
thousand crowns a year. If this cannot be had in one benefice, let him have two or three to that amount, for in his case it will come to the same thing." As I was standing by, I could hear what the King
said, and thanked his Majesty at once for the donation, as though I were already in possession. I told him that as soon as his orders were carried into effect, I would work for his Majesty without other
salary or recompense of any kind until old age deprived me of the power to labour, when I hoped to rest my tired body in peace, maintaining
myself with honour on that income, and always bearing in mind that I had served so great a monarch as his Majesty. At the end of this speech the King turned toward me with a lively gesture
and a joyous countenance, saying, "So let it then be done." After
that he departed, highly satisfied with what he had seen there.
      </p>

      <h3>XL</h3>

      <p>
        Madame d'Etampes, when she heard how well my affairs were going,
redoubled her spite against me, saying in her own heart: "It is I who rule the world to-day, and a little fellow like that snaps his fingers at me!" She put every iron into the fire which she could
think of, in order to stir up mischief against me. Now a certain man fell in her way, who enjoyed great fame as a distiller; he supplied
her with perfumed waters, which were excellent for the complexion, and hitherto unknown in France. This fellow she introduced to the King, who was much delighted by the processes for
distilling which he exhibited. While engaged in these experiments,
the man begged his Majesty to give him a tennis-court I had in my
castle, together with some little apartments which he said I did not
use. The good King, guessing who was at the bottom of the business,
made no answer; but Madame d'Etampes used those wiles with
which women know so well to work on men, and very easily succeeded in her enterprise; for having taken the King at a moment of amorous weakness, to which he was much subject, she wheedled
him into conceding what she wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distiller came, accompanied by Treasurer Grolier, a very
great nobleman of France, who spoke Italian excellently, and when he entered my castle, began to jest with me in that language.
Watching his opportunity, he said: "In the King's name I put this man here into possession of that tennis-court, together with the lodgings that pertain to it." To this I answered: "The sacred King
is lord of all things here: so then you might have effected an entrance with more freedom: coming thus with notaries and people of the
court looks more like a fraud than the mandate of a powerful monarch.
I assure you that, before I carry my complaints before the King, I shall defend my right in the way his Majesty gave me orders two days since to do. I shall fling the man whom you have put upon
me out of windows if I do not see a warrant under the King's own
hand and seal." After this speech the treasurer went off threatening
and grumbling, and I remained doing the same, without, however,
beginning the attack at once. Then I went to the notaries who had
put the fellow in possession. I was well acquainted with them; and
they gave me to understand that this was a formal proceeding, done
indeed at the King's orders, but which had not any great significance; if I had offered some trifling opposition the fellow would
not have installed himself as he had done. The formalities were acts and customs of the court, which did not concern obedience to the King; consequently, if I succeeded in ousting him, I should have
acted rightly, and should not incur any risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        This hint was enough for me, and next morning I had recourse to arms; and though the job cost me some trouble, I enjoyed it. Each
day that followed, I made an attack with stones, pikes and arquebuses,
firing, however, without ball; nevertheless, I inspired such
terror that no one dared to help my antagonist. Accordingly, when
I noticed one day that his defence was feeble, I entered the house by
force, and expelled the fellow, turning all his goods and chattels into the street. Then I betook me to the King, and told him that I had
done precisely as his Majesty had ordered, by defending myself
against every one who sought to hinder me in his service. The King
laughed at the matter, and made me out new letters-patent to secure me from further molestation.
