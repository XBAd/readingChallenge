      <p>
        'And we came to the isle Aeaean, where dwelt Circe of the
braided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Aeetes. Both were begotten of Helios, who gives light
to all men, and their mother was Perse, daughter of Oceanus. There on the shore we put in with our ship into the sheltering haven
silently, and some god was our guide. Then we stept ashore, and
for two days and two nights lay there, consuming our own hearts for weariness and pain. But when now the fair-tressed Dawn had
brought the full light of the third day, then did I seize my spear and my sharp sword, and quickly departing from the ship I went
up unto a place of wide prospect, if haply I might see any sign
of the labour of men and hear the sound of their speech. So I went
up a craggy hill, a place of out-look, and I saw the smoke rising
from the broad-wayed earth in the halls of Circe, through the thick coppice and the woodland. Then I mused in my mind and heart whether I should go and make discovery, for that I had seen the smoke and flame. And as I thought thereon this seemed to me the
better counsel, to go first to the swift ship and to the sea-banks,
and give my company their midday meal, and then send them to make search. But as I came and drew nigh to the curved ship, some god even then took pity on me in my loneliness, and sent a tall andered stag across my very path. He was coming down from his pasture in the woodland to the river to drink, for verily the might
of the sun was sore upon him. And as he came up from out of the stream, I smote him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the brazen shaft went clean through him, and with a moan he fell in the dust, and his life passed from him. Then I set my foot on him
and drew forth the brazen shaft from the wound, and laid it hard
by upon the ground and let it lie. Next I broke withies and willow
twigs, and wove me a rope a fathom in length, well twisted from
end to end, and bound together the feet of the huge beast, and
went to the black ship bearing him across my neck, and leaning on a spear, for it was in no wise possible to carry him on my shoulder
with the one hand, for he was a mighty quarry. And I threw him
down before the ship and roused my company with soft words,
standing by each man in turn:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Friends, for all our sorrows we shall not yet a while go down
to the house of Hades, ere the coming of the day of destiny; go to then, while as yet there is meat and drink in the swift ship, let us
take thought thereof, that we be not famished for hunger."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Even so I spake, and they speedily hearkened to my words. They
unmuffled their heads, and there on the shore of the unharvested
sea gazed at the stag, for he was a mighty quarry. But after they
had delighted their eyes with the sight of him, they washed their hands and got ready the glorious feast. So for that time we sat the
livelong day till the going down of the sun, feasting on abundant
flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun sank and darkness had come
on, then we laid us to rest upon the sea beach. So soon as early
Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, I called a gathering of my men
and spake in the ears of them all:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Hear my words, my fellows, despite your evil case. My friends,
lo, now we know not where is the place of darkness or of dawning,
nor where the Sun, that gives light to men, goes beneath the earth, nor where he rises; therefore let us advise us speedily if any counsel
yet may be: as for me, I deem there is none. For I went up a craggy
hill, a place of out-look, and saw the island crowned about with the
circle of the endless sea, the isle itself lying low; and in the midst
thereof mine eyes beheld the smoke through the thick coppice and
the woodland."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Even so I spake, but their spirit within them was broken, as they
remembered the deeds of Antiphates the Laestrygonian, and all the
evil violence of the haughty Cyclops, the man-eater. So they wept
aloud shedding big tears. Howbeit no avail came of their weeping.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Then I numbered my goodly-greaved company in two bands,
and appointed a leader for each, and I myself took the command
of the one part, and godlike Eurylochus of the other. And anon we shook the lots in a brazen-fitted helmet, and out leapt the lot of proud Eurylochus. So he went on his way, and with him two
and twenty of my fellowship all weeping; and we were left behind
making lament. In the forest glades they found the halls of Circe
builded, of polished stone, in a place with wide prospect. And
all around the palace mountain-bred wolves and lions were roaming,
whom she herself had bewitched with evil drugs that she gave
them. Yet the beasts did not set on my men, but lo, they ramped
about them and fawned on them, wagging their long tails. And
as when dogs fawn about their lord when he comes from the feast, for he always brings them the fragments that soothe their mood,
even so the strong clawed wolves and the lions fawned around them;
but they were affrighted when they saw the strange and terrible creatures. So they stood at the outer gate of the fair-tressed goddess,
and within they heard Circe singing in a sweet voice, as she fared to and fro before the great web imperishable, such as is the handiwork
of goddesses, fine of woof and full of grace and splendour.
Then Polites, a leader of men, the dearest to me and the trustiest of
all my company, first spake to them:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Friends, forasmuch as there is one within that fares to and
fro before a mighty web singing a sweet song, so that all the floor of the hall makes echo, a goddess she is or a woman; come quickly
and cry aloud to her."
      </p>

      <p>
        'He spake the word and they cried aloud and called to her. And
straightway she came forth and opened the shining doors and bade
them in, and all went with her in their heedlessness. But Eurylochus
tarried behind, for he guessed that there was some treason. So she led them in and set them upon chairs and high seats, and
made them a mess of cheese and barley-meal and yellow honey with
Pramnian wine, and mixed harmful drugs with the food to make
them utterly forget their own country. Now when she had given
them the cup and they had drunk it off, presently she smote them
with a wand, and in the styes of the swine she penned them. So
they had the head and voice, the bristles and the shape of swine,
but their mind abode even as of old. Thus were they penned there weeping, and Circe flung them acorns and mast and fruit of the cornel tree to eat, whereon wallowing swine do always batten.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Now Eurylochus came back to the swift black ship to bring tidings of his fellows, and of their unseemly doom. Not a word could
he utter, for all his desire, so deeply smitten was he to the heart with
grief, and his eyes were filled with tears and his soul was fain of lamentation. But when we all had pressed him with our questions
in amazement, even then he told the fate of the remnant of our company.
      </p>

      <p>
        '"We went, as thou didst command, through the coppice, noble
Odysseus: we found within the forest glades the fair halls, builded
of polished stone, in a place with wide prospect. And there was one
that fared before a mighty web and sang a clear song, a goddess
she was or a woman, and they cried aloud and called to her. And
straightway she came forth, and opened the shining doors and
bade them in, and they all went with her in their heedlessness. But I tarried behind, for I guessed that there was some treason. Then they vanished away one and all, nor did any of them appear again,
though I sat long time watching."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake he, whereon I cast about my shoulder my silver-studded sword, a great blade of bronze, and slung my bow about me and
bade him lead me again by the way that he came. But he caught
me with both hands, and by my knees he besought me, and bewailing him spake to me winged words:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Lead me not thither against my will, oh fosterling of Zeus, but
leave me here! For well I know thou shalt thyself return no more,
nor bring any one of all thy fellowship; nay, let us flee the swifter with those that be here, for even yet may we escape the evil day."
      </p>

      <p>
        'On this wise he spake, but I answered him, saying: "Eurylochus,
abide for thy part here in this place, eating and drinking by the
black hollow ship: but I will go forth, for a strong constraint is
laid on me."
      </p>

      <p>
        'With that I went up from the ship and the sea-shore. But lo, when
in my faring through the sacred glades I was now drawing near
to the great hall of the enchantress Circe, then did Hermes, of the
golden wand, meet me as I approached the house, in the likeness
of a young man with the first down on his lip, the time when
youth is most gracious. So he clasped my hand and spake and
hailed me:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Ah, hapless man, whither away again, all alone through the
wolds, thou that knowest not this country? And thy company
yonder in the hall of Circe are penned in the guise of swine, in
their deep lairs abiding. Is it in hope to free them that thou art come hither? Nay, methinks, thou thyself shalt never return but
remain there with the others. Come then, I will redeem thee from
thy distress, and bring deliverance. Lo, take this herb of virtue,
and go to the dwelling of Circe, that it may keep from thy head the
evil day. And I will tell thee all the magic sleight of Circe. She
will mix thee a potion and cast drugs into the mess; but not even
so shall she be able to enchant thee; so helpful is this charmed herb
that I shall give thee, and I will tell thee all. When it shall be that
Circe smites thee with her long wand, even then draw thou thy
sharp sword from thy thigh, and spring on her, as one eager to slay
her. And she will shrink away and be instant with thee to lie with her. Thenceforth disdain not thou the bed of the goddess, that she may deliver thy company and kindly entertain thee. But command
her to swear a mighty oath by the blessed gods, that she will plan
nought else of mischief to thine own hurt, lest she make thee a
dastard and unmanned, when she hath thee naked."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Therewith the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had
plucked from the ground, and he showed me the growth thereof.
It was black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Then Hermes departed toward high Olympus, up through the woodland isle, but as for me I held on my way to the house of Circe,
and my heart was darkly troubled as I went. So I halted in the
portals of the fair-tressed goddess; there I stood and called aloud
and the goddess heard my voice, who presently came forth and
opened the shining doors and bade me in, and I went with her
heavy at heart. So she led me in and set me on a chair with studs of silver, a goodly carven chair, and beneath was a footstool for the
feet. And she made me a potion in a golden cup, that I might drink,
and she also put a charm therein, in the evil counsel of her heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Now when she had given it and I had drunk it off and was not bewitched, she smote me with her wand and spake and hailed me:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Go thy way now to the stye, couch thee there with the rest of thy company."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake she, but I drew my sharp sword from my thigh and
sprang upon Circe, as one eager to slay her. But with a great cry she slipped under, and clasped my knees, and bewailing herself spake to me winged words:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence? Where is thy
city? Where are they that begat thee? I marvel to see how thou
hast drunk of this charm, and wast nowise subdued. Nay, for there
lives no man else that is proof against this charm, whoso hath
drunk thereof, and once it hath passed his lips. But thou hast,
methinks, a mind within thee that may not be enchanted. Verily
thou art Odysseus, ready at need, whom he of the golden wand,
the slayer of Argos, full often told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with his swift black ship. Nay come, put thy sword into the sheath, and thereafter let us go up into my bed, that meeting
in love and sleep we may trust each the other."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake she, but I answered her, saying: "Nay, Circe, how
canst thou bid me be gentle to thee, who hast turned my company
into swine within thy halls, and holding me here with a guileful heart requirest me to pass within thy chamber and go up into thy
bed, that so thou mayest make me a dastard and unmanned when
thou hast me naked? Nay, never will I consent to go up into thy
bed, except thou wilt deign, goddess, to swear a mighty oath, that thou wilt plan nought else of mischief to mine own hurt."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and she straightway swore the oath not to harm me,
as I bade her. But when she had sworn and had done that oath,
then at last I went up into the beautiful bed of Circe.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Now all this while her handmaids busied them in the halls, four
maidens that are her serving women in the house. They are born
of the wells and of the woods and of the holy rivers, that flow forward into the salt sea. Of these one cast upon the chairs goodly
coverlets of purple above, and spread a linen cloth thereunder. And
lo, another drew up silver tables to the chairs, and thereon set for them golden baskets. And a third mixed sweet honey-hearted wine
in a silver bowl, and set out cups of gold. And a fourth bare water,
and kindled a great fire beneath the mighty cauldron. So the water
waxed warm; but when it boiled in the bright brazen vessel, she
set me in a bath and bathed me with water from out a great cauldron, pouring it over head and shoulders, when she had mixed it to a pleasant warmth, till from my limbs she took away the consuming
weariness. Now after she had bathed me and anointed me well with oUve oil, and cast about me a fair mantle and a doublet, she
led me into the halls and set me on a chair with studs of silver, a goodly carven chair, and beneath was a footstool for the feet. And
a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly golden ewer, and
poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal; and to my side she drew a polished table, and a grave dame bare wheaten bread
and set it by me, and laid on the board many dainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her. And she bade me eat, but my
soul found no pleasure therein. I sat with other thoughts, and my
heart had a boding of ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Now when Circe saw that I sat thus, and that I put not forth my hands to the meat, and that I was mightily afflicted, she drew
near to me and spake to me winged words:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Wherefore thus, Odysseus, dost thou sit there like a speechless
man, consuming thine own soul, and dost not touch meat nor drink?
Dost thou indeed deem there is some further guile? Nay, thou
hast no cause to fear, for already I have sworn thee a strong oath
not to harm thee."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake she, but I answered her, saying: "Oh, Circe, what
righteous man would have the heart to taste meat and drink ere he
had redeemed his company, and beheld them face to face? But if in good faith thou biddest me eat and drink, then let them go free, that mine eyes may behold my dear companions."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So I spake, and Circe passed out through the hall with the wand
in her hand, and opened the doors of the stye, and drave them forth
in the shape of swine of nine seasons old. There they stood before
her, and she went through their midst, and anointed each one of them with another charm. And lo, from their limbs the bristles dropped away, wherewith the venom had erewhile clothed them,
that lady Circe gave them. And they became men again, younger
than before they were, and goodlier far, and taller to behold. And
they all knew me again and each one took my hands, and wistful was the lament that sank into their souls, and the roof around rang
wondrously. And even the goddess herself was moved with compassion.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Then standing nigh me the fair goddess spake unto me: "Son of
Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, depart now
to thy swift ship and the sea-banks. And first of all, draw ye up the
ship ashore, and bestow the goods in the caves and all the gear. And thyself return again, and bring with thee thy dear companions."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake she, and my lordly spirit consented thereto. So I went on my way to the swift ship and the sea-banks, and there I found
my dear company on the swift ship lamenting piteously, shedding
big tears. And as when calves of the homestead gather round the droves of kine that have returned to the yard, when they have had
their fill of pasture, and all with one accord frisk before them, and
the folds may no more contain them, but with a ceaseless lowing they skip about their dams, so flocked they all about me weeping,
when their eyes beheld me. Yea, and to their spirit it was as though
they had got to their dear country, and the very city of rugged
Ithaca, where they were born and reared.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Then making lament they spake to me winged words: "O fosterling of Zeus, we were none otherwise glad at thy returning, than
if we had come to Ithaca, our own country. Nay come, of our other
companions tell us the tale of their ruin."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake they, but I answered them with soft words: "Behold,
let us first of all draw up the ship ashore, and bestow our goods
in the caves and all our gear. And do ye bestir you, one and all, to go with me, that ye may see your fellows in the sacred dwelling
of Circe, eating and drinking, for they have continual store."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake I, and at once they hearkened to my words, but Eurylochus
alone would have holden all my companions, and uttering
his voice he spake to them winged words:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Wretched men that we are! whither are we going? Why are your hearts so set on sorrow that ye should go down to the hall of
Circe, who will surely change us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, to guard her great house perforce, according to the deeds that the
Cyclops wrought, when certain of our company went to his inmost
fold, and with them went Odysseus, ever hardy, for through the
blindness of his heart did they too perish?"
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake he, but I mused in my heart whether to draw my long
hanger from my stout thigh, and therewith smite off his head and
bring it to the dust, albeit he was very near of kin to me, but the men of my company stayed me on every side with soothing words:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Prince of the seed of Zeus, as for this man, we will suffer him,
if thou wilt have it so, to abide here by the ship and guard the ship;
but as for us, be our guide to the sacred house of Circe."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So they spake and went up from the ship and the sea. Nay, nor
yet was Eurylochus left by the hollow ship, but he went with us, for he feared my terrible rebuke.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Meanwhile Circe bathed the rest of my company in her halls with all care, and anointed them well with olive oil and cast thick mantles and doublets about them. And we found them all feasting
nobly in the halls. And when they saw and knew each other face to face, they wept and mourned, and the house rang around. Then
she stood near me, that fair goddess, and spake saying:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, no more now wake this plenteous weeping: myself I know of all the pains ye endured upon the teeming deep, and the great despite
done you by unkindly men upon the land. Nay come, eat ye meat
and drink wine, till your spirit shall return to you again, as it was when first ye left your own country of rugged Ithaca; but now are ye wasted and wanting heart, mindful evermore of your sore wandering,
nor has your heart ever been merry, for very grievous hath been
your trial."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake she, and our lordly spirit consented thereto. So there we sat day by day for the full circle of a year, feasting on abundant
flesh and sweet wine. But when now a year had gone, and the seasons returned as the months waned, and the long days came in their course, then did my dear company call me forth, and say:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Good sir, now is it high time to mind thee of thy native land,
if it is ordained that thou shalt be saved, and come to thy lofty house
and thine own country."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake they and my lordly spirit consented thereto. So for that time we sat the livelong day till the going down of the sun, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun sank and
darkness came on, they laid them to rest throughout the shadowy
halls.
      </p>

      <p>
        'But when I had gone up into the fair bed of Circe, I besought her
by her knees, and the goddess heard my speech, and uttering my
voice I spake to her winged words: "Circe, fulfil for me the promise
which thou madest me to send me on my homeward way. Now is my spirit eager to be gone, and the spirit of my company, that wear away my heart as they mourn around me, when haply thou art gone from us."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: "Son of
Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, tarry ye now no longer in my house against your will; but first must ye perform another journey, and reach the dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind
soothsayer, whose wits abide steadfast To him Persephone hath given judgment, even in death, that he alone should have understanding;
but the other souls sweep shadow-like around."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Thus spake she, but as for me, my heart was broken, and I wept
as I sat upon the bed, and my soul had no more care to live and to
see the sunlight. But when I had my fill of weeping and grovelling,
then at the last I answered and spake unto her saying: "And who,
Circe, will guide us on this way? for no man ever yet sailed to hell in a black ship,"
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: "Son of
Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, nay, trouble
not thyself for want of a guide, by thy ship abiding, but set up the
mast and spread abroad the white sails and sit thee down; and the
breeze of the North Wind will bear thy vessel on her way. But
when thou hast now sailed in thy ship across the stream Oceanus,
where is a waste shore and the groves of Persephone, even tall poplar trees and willows that shed their fruit before the season,
there beach thy ship by deep eddying Oceanus, but go thyself to
the dank house of Hades. Thereby into Acheron flows Pyriphlegethon,
and Cocytus, a branch of the water of the Styx, and there is a rock, and the meeting of the two roaring waters. So, hero, draw
nigh thereto, as I command thee, and dig a trench as it were a cubit
in length and breadth, and about it pour a drink-offering to all the
dead, first with mead and thereafter with sweet wine, and for the
third time with water, and sprinkle white meal thereon and entreat with many prayers the strengthless heads of the dead, and promise
that on thy return to Ithaca thou wilt offer in thy halls a barren
heifer, the best thou hast, and wilt fill the pyre with treasure, and
wilt sacrifice apart, to Teiresias alone, a black ram without spot, the
fairest of your flock. But when thou hast with prayers made supplication to the lordly races of the dead, then offer up a ram and a
black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus and thyself turn
thy back, with thy face set for the shore of the river. Then will many spirits come to thee of the dead that be departed. Thereafter
thou shalt call to thy company and command them to flay the sheep
which even now lie slain by the pitiless sword, and to consume them
with fire, and to make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and to dread Persephone. And thyself draw the sharp sword from thy thigh and sit there, suffering not the strengthless heads of the dead
to draw nigh to the blood, ere thou hast word of Teiresias. Then
the seer will come to thee quickly, leader of the people; he will surely declare to thee the way and the measure of thy path, and as touching
thy returning, how thou mayst go over the teeming deep."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake she, and anon came the golden throned Dawn. Then
she put on me a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and the nymph
clad herself in a great shining robe, light of woof and gracious, and
about her waist she cast a fair golden girdle, and put a veil upon
her head. But I passed through the halls and roused my men with
smooth words, standing by each one in turn:
      </p>

      <p>
        '"Sleep ye now no more nor breathe sweet slumber; but let us go on our way, for surely she hath shown me all, the lady Circe."
      </p>

      <p>
        'So spake I, and their lordly soul consented thereto. Yet even
thence I led not my company safe away. There was one, Elpenor,
the youngest of us all, not very valiant in war, neither steadfast in mind. He was lying apart from the rest of my men on the housetop
of Circe's sacred dwelling, very fain of the cool air, as one heavy
with wine. Now when he heard the noise of the voices and of the
feet of my fellows as they moved to and fro, he leaped up of a sudden and minded him not to descend again by the way of the
tall ladder, but fell right down from the roof, and his neck was
broken from the bones of the spine, and his spirit went down to the house of Hades.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Then I spake among my men as they went on their way, saying:
"Ye deem now, I see, that ye are going to your own dear country;
but Circe hath showed us another way, even to the dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone, to seek to the spirit of Theban
Teiresias."
      </p>

      <p>
        'Even so I spake, but their heart within them was broken, and
they sat them down even where they were, and made lament and
tore their hair. Howbeit no help came of their weeping.
