          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Drummond_of_Hawthornden" target="_blank"><em>William Drummond</em></a>
            (13 December 1585 – 4 December 1649), called "of Hawthornden", was a Scottish poet.
            Drummond's most important works are the <em>Cypresse Grove</em> and the poems.
            The <em>Cypresse Grove</em> exhibits great wealth of illustration, and an
            extraordinary command of musical English. It is an essay on the
            folly of the fear of death. "This globe of the earth," says he,
            "which seemeth huge to us, in respect of the universe, and compared
            with that wide pavilion of heaven; is less than little, of no
            sensible quantity, and but as a point." This is one of Drummond's
            favourite moods; and he uses constantly in his poems such phrases as
            "the All," "this great All." Even in such of his poems as may be called
            more distinctively Christian, this philosophic conception is at work.

      <h2>WILLIAM DRUMMOND</h2>
      <h3>[1585 - 1649]</h3>

      <h3>Saint John Baptist</h3>
      <p>
        The last and greatest Herald of Heaven's King <br>
Girt with rough skins, <span class="tooltip">hies<span class="tooltiptext">hurries; hastens</span></span> to the deserts wild, <br>
Among that savage brood the woods forth bring, <br>
Which he more harmless found than man, and mild. <br>
His food was locusts, and what there doth spring,<br>
With honey that from virgin hives distill'd; <br>
Parch'd body, hollow eyes, some uncouth thing <br>
Made him appear, long since from earth exiled. <br>
There burst he forth: All ye whose hopes rely <br>
On God, with me amidst these deserts mourn,<br>
Repent, repent, and from old errors turn! <br>
— Who listen'd to his voice, obey'd his cry?<br>
Only the echoes, which he made relent, <br>
Rung from their flinty caves, Repent! Repent!
      </p>

      <h3>Madrigal</h3>
      <p>
        My thoughts hold mortal strife; <br>
I do detest my life, <br>
And with lamenting cries <br>
Peace to my soul to bring <br>
Oft call that prince which here doth monarchize: <br>
— But he, grim grinning King,<br>
Who <span class="tooltip">caitiffs<span class="tooltiptext">contemptible or cowardly persons.</span></span> scorns, and doth the blest surprize,<br>
Late having deck'd with beauty's rose his tomb,<br>
Disdains to crop a weed, and will not come.
      </p>

      <h3>Life</h3>
      <p>
        This Life, which seems so fair,<br>
Is like a bubble blown up in the air <br>
By sporting children's breath, <br>
Who chase it everywhere<br>
And strive who can most motion it bequeath.<br>
And though it sometimes seem of its own might<br>
Like to an eye of gold to be fix'd there, <br>
And firm to hover in that empty height,<br>
That only is because it is so light.<br>
— But in that pomp it doth not long appear; <br>
For when 'tis most admired, in a thought, <br>
Because it erst was nought, it turns to nought.
      </p>

      <h3>Human Folly</h3>
      <p>
        Of this fair volume which we World do name<br>
If we the sheets and leaves could turn with care, <br>
Of him who it corrects, and did it frame,<br>
We clear might read the art and wisdom rare: <br>
Find out his power which wildest powers doth tame,<br>
His providence extending everywhere,<br>
His justice which proud rebels doth not spare,<br>
In every page, no period of the same. <br>
But silly we, like foolish children, rest <br>
Well pleased with colour'd <span class="tooltip">vellum<span class="tooltiptext">fine parchment made originally from the skin of a calf.</span></span>, leaves of gold. <br>
Fair dangling ribbands, leaving what is best,<br>
On the great writer's sense ne'er taking hold;<br>
Or if by chance we stay our minds on aught,<br>
It is some picture on the margin wrought.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Doth then the world go thus, doth all thus move?<br>
Is this the justice which on Earth we find?<br>
Is this that firm decree which all doth bind?<br>
Are these your influences, Powers above?<br>
Those souls which vice's moody mists most blind, <br>
Blind Fortune, blindly, most their friend doth prove;<br>
And they who thee, poor idol Virtue! love, <br>
Ply like a feather toss'd by storm and wind.<br>
Ah! if a Providence doth sway this all <br>
Why should best minds groan under most distress? <br>
Or why should pride humility make thrall, <br>
And injuries the innocent oppress?<br>
Heavens! hinder, stop this fate; or grant a time<br>
When good may have, as well as bad, their prime!
      </p>

      <h3>To His Lute</h3>
      <p>
        My lute, be as thou wert when thou didst grow<br>
With thy green mother in some shady grove,<br>
When immelodious winds but made thee move,<br>
And birds their <span class="tooltip">ramage<span class="tooltiptext">the boughs or branches of a tree</span></span> did on thee bestow.<br>
Since that dear Voice which did thy sounds approve, <br>
Which wont in such harmonious strains to flow,<br>
Is reft from Earth to tune those spheres above,<br>
What art thou but a harbinger of woe?<br>
Thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more, <br>
But orphans' wailings to the fainting ear; <br>
Each stroke a sigh, each sound draws forth a tear; <br>
For which be silent as in woods before: <br>
Or if that any hand to touch thee deign,<br>
Like widow'd turtle still her loss complain.
      </p>

      <h3>For the Magdalene</h3>
      <p>
        These eyes, dear Lord, once brandons of desire, <br>
        Frail scouts betraying what they had to keep,<br>
Which their own heart, then others set on fire,<br>
Their trait'rous black before thee here out-weep;<br>
These locks, of blushing deeds the gilt attire, <br>
Waves curling, wrackful shelves to shadow deep,<br>
Rings wedding souls to sin's lethargic sleep,<br>
To touch thy sacred feet do now aspire. <br>
In seas of care behold a sinking bark,<br>
By winds of sharp remorse unto thee driven,<br>
O let me not be Ruin's aim'd-at-mark! <br>
My faults confessed. Lord, say they are forgiven.'<br>
Thus sighed to Jesus the Bethanian fair,<br>
His tear-wet feet still drying with her hair.
      </p>

      <h3>Content and Resolute</h3>
      <p>
        As when it happeneth that some lovely town<br>
Unto a barbarous besieger falls, <br>
Who there by sword and flame himself installs, <br>
And, cruel, it in tears and blood doth drown;<br>
Her beauty spoiled, her citizens made thralls,<br>
His spite yet so can not her all throw down<br>
But that some statue, arch, fane of renown<br>
Yet lurks unmaimed within her weeping walls:<br>
So, after all the spoil, disgrace, and wrack,<br>
That time, the world, and death, could bring combined,<br>
Amidst that mass of ruins they did make,<br>
Safe and all scarless yet remains my mind.<br>
From this so high transcending rapture springs,<br>
That I, all else defaced, not envy kings.
      </p>

      <h3>Alexis, Here She Stayed; Among These Pines</h3>
      <p>
        Alexis, here she stayed; among these pines,<br>
        Sweet hermitress, she did alone repair;<br>
Here did she spread the treasure of her hair,<br>
More rich than that brought from the <span class="tooltip">Colchian<span class="tooltiptext">an early Bronze Age and Iron Age culture of the western Caucasus, mostly in western Georgia</span></span> mines;<br>
She set her by these musked <span class="tooltip">eglantines<span class="tooltiptext">A Eurasian rose, Rosa eglanteria, having prickly stems, fragrant leaves, pink flowers and red hips</span></span>. — <br>
The happy place the print seems yet to bear; — <br>
Her voice did sweeten here thy sugared lines, <br>
To which winds, trees, beasts, birds, did lend their ear: <br>
Me here she first perceived, and here a morn<br>
Of bright carnations did o'erspread her face; <br>
Here did she sigh, here first my hopes were born,<br>
And I first got a pledge of promised grace; <br>
But ah! what served it to be happy so, <br>
Sith passed pleasures double but new woe?
      </p>

      <h3>Summons to Love</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="tooltip">Phoebus<span class="tooltiptext">(also known as Apollo) is one of the Olympian deities in Greek and Roman mythology</span></span>, arise! <br>
        And paint the <span class="tooltip">sable<span class="tooltiptext">the color black</span></span> skies <br>
        With azure, white, and red: <br>
        Rouse <span class="tooltip">Memnon<span class="tooltiptext">In Greek mythology, Memnon was an Ethiopian king. As a warrior he was considered to be almost Achilles' equal in skill.</span></span>'s mother from her <span class="tooltip">Tithon<span class="tooltiptext">Father of Memnon</span></span>'s bed<br>
That she may thy career with roses spread: <br>
The nightingales thy coming eachwhere sing:<br>
Make an eternal Spring!<br>
Give life to this dark world which lieth dead;<br>
Spread forth thy golden hair <br>
In larger locks than thou wast wont before,<br>
And emperor-like decore <br>
With <span class="tooltip">diadem<span class="tooltiptext">a jeweled crown or headband worn as a symbol of sovereignty.</span></span> of pearl thy temples fair: <br>
Chase hence the ugly night<br>
Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light<br>
— This is that happy morn,<br>
That day, long-wished day<br>
Of all my life so dark,<br>
(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn <br>
And fates my hopes betray),<br>
Which, purely white, deserves <br>
An everlasting diamond should it mark.<br>
This is the morn should bring unto this grove <br>
My Love, to hear and recompense my love. <br>
Fair King, who all preserves,<br>
But show thy blushing beams,<br>
And thou two sweeter eyes <br>
Shalt see than those which by Penéus' streams <br>
Did once thy heart surprize.<br>
Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise:<br>
If that ye winds would hear <br>
A voice surpassing far Amphion's lyre, <br>
Your furious chiding stay; <br>
Let Zephyr only breathe,<br>
And with her <span class="tooltip">tresses<span class="tooltiptext">a long lock of a woman's hair.</span></span> play.<br>
— The winds all silent are, <br>
And Phoebus in his chair <br>
Ensaffroning sea and air <br>
Makes vanish every star: <br>
Night like a drunkard reels <br>
Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels: <br>
The fields with flowers are deck'd in every hue. <br>
The clouds with orient gold <span class="tooltip">spangle<span class="tooltiptext">sparkling; glittering</span></span> their blue; <br>
Here is the pleasant place — <br>
And nothing wanting is, save She, alas!
