          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" target="_blank"><em>Robert Burns</em></a> (25 January 1759 – 21 July 1796)
          was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.
          He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature.

      <h2>The Cotter’s Saturday Night</h2>

      <p>
        Inscribed to R. Aiken, Esq.
        <blockquote>
          “Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, <br>
            Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;<br>
          Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,<br>
            The short and simple annals of the Poor.

      <p>
        MY lov’d, my honour’d, much respected friend!<br>
          No mercenary bard his homage pays;<br>
        With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end,<br>
          My dearest <span class="tooltip">meed<span class="tooltiptext">a deserved share or reward.</span></span>, a friend’s esteem and praise:<br>
          To you I sing, in simple Scottish <span class="tooltip">lays<span class="tooltiptext">a short lyric or narrative poem meant to be sung.</span></span>,<br>
        The lowly train in life’s sequester’d scene,<br>
          The native feelings strong, the guileless ways,<br>
        What Aiken in a cottage would have been;<br>
        Ah! tho’ his worth unknown, far happier there I ween!
      </p>

      <p>
        November chill blaws loud wi’ angry sugh;<br>
          The short’ning winter-day is near a close;<br>
        The <span class="tooltip">miry<span class="tooltiptext">very muddy or boggy.</span></span> beasts retreating frae the pleugh;<br>
          The black’ning trains o’ craws to their repose:<br>
          The toil-worn <span class="tooltip">Cotter<span class="tooltiptext">(in Scotland and Ireland) a farm laborer or tenant occupying a cottage in return for labor.</span></span> frae his labour goes,—<br>
        This night his weekly <span class="tooltip">moil<span class="tooltiptext">hard work; drudgery.</span></span> is at an end,<br>
          Collects his spades, his <span class="tooltip">mattocks<span class="tooltiptext">an agricultural tool shaped like a pickax, with an adze and a chisel edge as the ends of the head.</span></span>, and his hoes,<br>
        Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend,<br>
        And weary, o’er the moor, his course does hameward bend.
      </p>

      <p>
        At length his lonely cot appears in view,<br>
          Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;<br>
        Th’ expectant wee-things, toddlin, <span class="tooltip">stacher<span class="tooltiptext">Scottish variant of Stagger</span></span> through<br>
          To meet their dead, wi’ flichterin noise and glee.<br>
          His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,<br>
        His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie’s smile,<br>
          The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,<br>
        Does a’ his weary kiaugh and care beguile,<br>
        And makes him quite forget his labour and his toil.
      </p>

      <p>
        Belyve, the elder <span class="tooltip">bairns<span class="tooltiptext">children</span></span> come drapping in,<br>
          At service out, amang the farmers roun’;<br>
        Some ca’ the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin<br>
          A cannie errand to a neibor town:<br>
          Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman-grown,<br>
        In youthfu’ bloom-love sparkling in her e’e—<br>
          Comes hame, perhaps to shew a braw new gown,<br>
        Or deposite her sair-won penny-fee,<br>
        To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be.
      </p>

      <p>
        With joy unfeign’d, brothers and sisters meet,<br>
          And each for other’s weelfare kindly speirs:<br>
        The social hours, swift-wing’d, unnotic’d fleet:<br>
          Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears.<br>
          The parents, partial, eye their hopeful years;<br>
        Anticipation forward points the view;<br>
          The mother, wi’ her needle and her shears,<br>
        Gars auld claes look amaist as weel’s the new;<br>
        The father mixes a’ wi’ admonition due.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their master’s and their mistress’ command,<br>
          The younkers a’ are warned to obey;<br>
        And mind their labours wi’ an eydent hand,<br>
          And ne’er, tho’ out o’ sight, to jauk or play;<br>
          “And O! be sure to fear the Lord alway,<br>
        And mind your duty, duly, morn and night;<br>
          Lest in temptation’s path ye gang astray,<br>
        Implore His counsel and assisting might:<br>
        They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But hark! a rap comes gently to the door;<br>
          Jenny, wha kens the meaning o’ the same,<br>
        Tells how a neibor lad came o’er the moor,<br>
          To do some errands, and convoy her hame.<br>
          The wily mother sees the conscious flame<br>
        Sparkle in Jenny’s e’e, and flush her cheek;<br>
          With heart-struck anxious care, enquires his name,<br>
        While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak;<br>
        Weel-pleased the mother hears, it’s nae wild, worthless <span class="tooltip">rake<span class="tooltiptext">a fashionable or wealthy man of dissolute or promiscuous habits.</span></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wi’ kindly welcome, Jenny brings him ben;<br>
          A strappin youth, he takes the mother’s eye;<br>
        Blythe Jenny sees the visit’s no ill ta’en;<br>
          The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and <span class="tooltip">kye<span class="tooltiptext">Scottish variant of "kine", a plural of cow</span></span>.<br>
          The youngster’s artless heart o’erflows wi’ joy,<br>
        But blate an’ laithfu’, scarce can weel behave;<br>
          The mother, wi’ a woman’s wiles, can spy<br>
        What makes the youth sae bashfu’ and sae grave,<br>
        Weel-pleas’d to think her bairn’s respected like the lave.
      </p>

      <p>
        O happy love! where love like this is found:<br>
          O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!<br>
        I’ve paced much this weary, mortal round,<br>
          And sage experience bids me this declare,—<br>
          “If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare—<br>
        One cordial in this melancholy vale,<br>
          ’Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair<br>
        In other’sarms, breathe out the tender tale,<br>
        Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Is there, in human form, that bears a heart,<br>
          A wretch! a villain! lost to love and truth!<br>
        That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art,<br>
          Betray sweet Jenny’s unsuspecting youth?<br>
          Curse on his perjur’d arts! dissembling smooth!<br>
        Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exil’d?<br>
          Is there no pity, no relenting ruth,<br>
        Points to the parents fondling o’er their child?<br>
        Then paints the ruin’d maid, and their distraction wild?
      </p>

      <p>
        But now the supper crowns their simple board,<br>
          The <span class="tooltip">halesome<span class="tooltiptext">healthy; wholesome</span></span> <span class="tooltip">parritch<span class="tooltiptext">a Scot word for porridge</span></span>, chief of Scotia’s food;<br>
        The sowp their only <span class="tooltip">hawkie<span class="tooltiptext">Scottish word for a white-faced cow, often used as a pet name for any cow.</span></span> does afford,<br>
          That, ’yont the hallan snugly chows her cood:<br>
          The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,<br>
        To grace the lad, her weel-hain’d <span class="tooltip">kebbuck<span class="tooltiptext">a whole wheel or ball of cheese</span></span>, fell;<br>
          And aft he’s prest, and aft he ca’s it guid:<br>
        The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell<br>
        How t’was a towmond auld, sin’ lint was i’ the bell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cheerfu’ supper done, wi’ serious face,<br>
          They, round the ingle, form a circle wide;<br>
        The sire turns o’er, with patriarchal grace,<br>
          The big ha’bible, ance his father’s pride:<br>
          His bonnet rev’rently is laid aside,<br>
        His <span class="tooltip">lyart<span class="tooltiptext">streaked with gray</span></span> <span class="tooltip">haffets<span class="tooltiptext">the part of the face above the upper jaw; the cheekbone and temple</span></span> wearing thin and bare;<br>
          Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,<br>
        He wales a portion with judicious care;<br>
        And “Let us worship God!” he says with solemn air.
      </p>

      <p>
        They chant their artless notes in simple guise,<br>
          They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim;<br>
        Perhaps Dundee’s wild-warbling measures rise;<br>
          Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name;<br>
          Or noble Elgin beets the heaven-ward flame;<br>
        The sweetest far of Scotia’s holy lays:<br>
          Compar’d with these, Italian trills are tame;<br>
        The tickl’d ears no heart-felt raptures raise;<br>
        Nae unison hae they with our Creator’s praise.
      </p>

      <p>
        The priest-like father reads the sacred page,<br>
          How Abram was the friend of God on high;<br>
        Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage<br>
          With <span class="tooltip">Amalek<span class="tooltiptext">a nation described in the Hebrew Bible as enemies of the Israelites</span></span>’s ungracious progeny;<br>
          Or how the royal bard did groaning lie<br>
        Beneath the stroke of Heaven’s avenging ire;<br>
          Or Job’s pathetic plaint, and wailing cry;<br>
        Or rapt Isaiah’s wild, seraphic fire;<br>
        Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme,<br>
          How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;<br>
        How He, who bore in Heaven the second name,<br>
          Had not on earth whereon to lay His head:<br>
          How His first followers and servants sped;<br>
        The precepts sage they wrote to many a land:<br>
          How he, who lone in <span class="tooltip">Patmos<span class="tooltiptext">a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea. It is the location of the vision given to the disciple John in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, and where the book was written</span></span> banished,<br>
        Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand,<br>
        And heard great Bab’lon’s doom pronounc’d by Heaven’s command.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, kneeling down to Heaven’s Eternal King,<br>
          The saint, the father, and the husband prays:<br>
        Hope “springs exulting on triumphant wing,”<br>
          That thus they all shall meet in future days,<br>
          There, ever bask in uncreated rays,<br>
        No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear,<br>
          Together hymning their Creator’s praise,<br>
        In such society, yet still more dear;<br>
        While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere
      </p>

      <p>
        Compar’d with this, how poor Religion’s pride,<br>
          In all the pomp of method, and of art;<br>
        When men display to congregations wide<br>
          Devotion’s ev’ry grace, except the heart!<br>
          The Power, incens’d, the pageant will desert,<br>
        The pompous strain, the <span class="tooltip">sacerdotal<span class="tooltiptext">relating to priests or the priesthood; priestly.</span></span> stole;<br>
          But haply, in some cottage far apart,<br>
        May hear, well-pleas’d, the language of the soul;<br>
        And in His Book of Life the inmates poor enroll.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then homeward all take off their sev’ral way;<br>
          The youngling cottagers retire to rest:<br>
        The parent-pair their secret homage pay,<br>
          And proffer up to Heaven the warm request,<br>
          That he who stills the raven’s clam’rous nest,<br>
        And decks the lily fair in flow’ry pride,<br>
          Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,<br>
        For them and for their little ones provide;<br>
        But chiefly, in their hearts with grace divine preside.
      </p>

      <p>
        From scenes like these, old Scotia’s grandeur springs,<br>
          That makes her lov’d at home, rever’d abroad:<br>
        Princes and lords are but the breath of kings,<br>
          “An honest man’s the noblest work of God;”<br>
          And <span class="tooltip">certes<span class="tooltiptext">assuredly; I assure you.</span></span>, in fair virtue’s heavenly road,<br>
        The cottage leaves the palace far behind;<br>
          What is a lordling’s pomp? a cumbrous load,<br>
        Disguising oft the wretch of human kind,<br>
        Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refin’d!
      </p>

      <p>
        O Scotia! my dear, my native soil!<br>
          For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent,<br>
        Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil<br>
          Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content!<br>
          And O! may Heaven their simple lives prevent<br>
        From luxury’s contagion, weak and vile!<br>
          Then howe’er crowns and <span class="tooltip">coronets<span class="tooltiptext">a small or relatively simple crown, especially as worn by lesser royalty and peers or peeresses.</span></span> be rent,<br>
        A virtuous populace may rise the while,<br>
        And stand a wall of fire around their much-lov’d isle.
      </p>

      <p>
        O Thou! who pour’d the patriotic tide,<br>
          That stream’d thro’ Wallace’s undaunted heart,<br>
        Who dar’d to nobly stem tyrannic pride,<br>
          Or nobly die, the second glorious part:<br>
          (The patriot’s God peculiarly thou art,<br>
        His friend, inspirer, guardian, and reward!)<br>
          O never, never Scotia’s realm desert;<br>
        But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard<br>
        In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard!
