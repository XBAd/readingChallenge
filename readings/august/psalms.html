      <h2>CX</h2>

      <h2>Jehovah Gives Dominion to the King</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        JEHOVAH saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, <br>
        Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. <br>
        [2]
        Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: <br>
        Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. <br>
        [3]
        Thy people offer themselves willingly <br>
        In the day of thy power, in holy array: <br>
        Out of the womb of the morning <br>
        Thou hast the dew of thy youth. <br>
        [4]
        Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: <br>
        Thou art a priest for ever <br>
        After the order of Melchizedek. <br>
        [5]
        The Lord at thy right hand <br>
        Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath. <br>
        [6]
        He will judge among the nations, <br>
        He will fill the places with dead bodies; <br>
        He will strike through the head in many countries. <br>
        [7]
        He will drink of the brook in the way: <br>
        Therefore will he lift up the head.
      </p>

      <h2>CXI</h2>

      <h2>Jehovah Praised for His Goodness</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        PRAISE ye Jehovah. <br>
        I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart,<br>
        In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.<br>
        [2]
        The works of Jehovah are great,<br>
        Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.<br>
        [3]
        His work is honor and majesty;<br>
        And his righteousness endureth for ever.<br>
        [4]
        He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:<br>
        Jehovah is gracious and merciful.<br>
        [5]
        He hath given food unto them that fear him:<br>
        He will ever be mindful of his covenant.<br>
        [6]
        He hath showed his people the power of his works,<br>
        In giving them the heritage of the nations.<br>
        [7]
        The works of his hands are truth and justice;<br>
        All his precepts are sure.<br>
        [8]
        They are established for ever and ever;<br>
        They are done in truth and uprightness.<br>
        [9]
        He hath sent redemption unto his people;<br>
        He hath commanded his covenant for ever:<br>
        Holy and reverend is his name.<br>
        [10]
        The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom;<br>
        A good understanding have all they that do his commandments:<br>
        His praise endureth for ever.
      </p>

      <h2>CXII</h2>

      <h2>Prosperity of Him That Fears Jehovah</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        PRAISE ye Jehovah. <br>
        Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah,<br>
        That delighteth greatly in his commandments.<br>
        [2]
        His seed shall be mighty upon earth:<br>
        The generation of the upright shall be blessed.<br>
        [3]
        Wealth and riches are in his house;<br>
        And his righteousness endureth for ever.<br>
        [4]
        Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:<br>
        He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.<br>
        [5]
        Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth;<br>
        He shall maintain his cause in judgment.<br>
        [6]
        For he shall never be moved;<br>
        The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.<br>
        [7]
        He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:<br>
        His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.<br>
        [8]
        His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,<br>
        Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.<br>
        [9]
        He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy;<br>
        His righteousness endureth for ever:<br>
        His horn shall be exalted with honor.<br>
        [10]
        The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;<br>
        He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:<br>
        The desire of the wicked shall perish.
      </p>

      <h2>CXIII</h2>

      <h2>Jehovah Exalts the Humble</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        PRAISE ye Jehovah. <br>
        Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah,<br>
        Praise the name of Jehovah.<br>
        [2]
        Blessed be the name of Jehovah<br>
        From this time forth and for evermore.<br>
        [3]
        From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same<br>
        Jehovah’s name is to be praised.<br>
        [4]
        Jehovah is high above all nations,<br>
        And his glory above the heavens.<br>
        [5]
        Who is like unto Jehovah our God,<br>
        That hath his seat on high,<br>
        [6]
        That humbleth himself to behold<br>
        The things that are in heaven and in the earth?<br>
        [7]
        He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,<br>
        And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;<br>
        [8]
        That he may set him with princes,<br>
        Even with the princes of his people.<br>
        [9]
        He maketh the barren woman to keep house,<br>
        And to be a joyful mother of children.<br>
        Praise ye Jehovah.
      </p>

      <h2>CXIV</h2>

      <h2>God’s Deliverance of Israel from Egypt</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        WHEN Israel went forth out of Egypt, <br>
        The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;<br>
        [2]
        Judah became his sanctuary,<br>
        Israel his dominion.<br>
        [3]
        The sea saw it, and fled;<br>
        The Jordan was driven back.<br>
        [4]
        The mountains skipped like rams,<br>
        The little hills like lambs.<br>
        [5]
        What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest?<br>
        Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?<br>
        [6]
        Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams;<br>
        Ye little hills, like lambs?<br>
        [7]
        Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,<br>
        At the presence of the God of Jacob,<br>
        [8]
        Who turned the rock into a pool of water,<br>
        The flint into a fountain of waters.
      </p>

      <h2>CXV</h2>

      <h2>Heathen Idols Contrasted with Jehovah</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        NOT unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, <br>
        But unto thy name give glory,<br>
        For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake.<br>
        [2]
        Wherefore should the nations say,<br>
        Where is now their God?<br>
        [3]
        But our God is in the heavens:<br>
        He hath done whatsoever he pleased.<br>
        [4]
        Their idols are silver and gold,<br>
        The work of men’s hands.<br>
        [5]
        They have mouths, but they speak not;<br>
        Eyes have they, but they see not;<br>
        [6]
        They have ears, but they hear not;<br>
        Noses have they, but they smell not;<br>
        [7]
        They have hands, but they handle not;<br>
        Feet have they, but they walk not;<br>
        Neither speak they through their throat.<br>
        [8]
        They that make them shall be like unto them;<br>
        Yea, every one that trusteth in them.<br>
        [9]
        O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah:<br>
        He is their help and their shield.<br>
        [10]
        O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah:<br>
        He is their help and their shield.<br>
        [11]
        Ye that fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah:<br>
        He is their help and their shield.<br>
        [12]
        Jehovah hath been mindful of us; he will bless us:<br>
        He will bless the house of Israel;<br>
        He will bless the house of Aaron.<br>
        [13]
        He will bless them that fear Jehovah,<br>
        Both small and great.<br>
        [14]
        Jehovah increase you more and more,<br>
        You and your children.<br>
        [15]
        Blessed are ye of Jehovah,<br>
        Who made heaven and earth.<br>
        [16]
        The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah;<br>
        But the earth hath he given to the children of men.<br>
        [17]
        The dead praise not Jehovah,<br>
        Neither any that go down into silence;<br>
        [18]
        But we will bless Jehovah<br>
        From this time forth and for evermore.<br>
        Praise ye Jehovah.

      <h2>CXVI</h2>

      <h2>Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Death</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        I LOVE Jehovah, because he heareth <br>
        My voice and my supplications.<br>
        [2]
        Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,<br>
        Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.<br>
        [3]
        The cords of death compassed me,<br>
        And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me:<br>
        I found trouble and sorrow.<br>
        [4]
        Then called I upon the name of Jehovah:<br>
        O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<br>
        [5]
        Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous;<br>
        Yea, our God is merciful.<br>
        [6]
        Jehovah preserveth the simple:<br>
        I was brought low, and he saved me.<br>
        [7]
        Return unto thy rest, O my soul;<br>
        For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.<br>
        [8]
        For thou hast delivered my soul from death,<br>
        Mine eyes from tears,<br>
        And my feet from falling.<br>
        [9]
        I will walk before Jehovah<br>
        In the land of the living.<br>
        [10]
        I believe, for I will speak:<br>
        I was greatly afflicted:<br>
        [11]
        I said in my haste,<br>
        All men are liars.<br>
        [12]
        What shall I render unto Jehovah<br>
        For all his benefits toward me?<br>
        [13]
        I will take the cup of salvation,<br>
        And call upon the name of Jehovah.<br>
        [14]
        I will pay my vows unto Jehovah,<br>
        Yea, in the presence of all his people.<br>
        [15]
        Precious in the sight of Jehovah<br>
        Is the death of his saints.<br>
        [16]
        O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant:<br>
        I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid;<br>
        Thou hast loosed my bonds.<br>
        [17]
        I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,<br>
        And will call upon the name of Jehovah.<br>
        [18]
        I will pay my vows unto Jehovah,<br>
        Yea, in the presence of all his people,<br>
        [19]
        In the courts of Jehovah’s house,<br>
        In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.<br>
        Praise ye Jehovah.
      </p>

      <h2>CXVII</h2>

      <h2>A Psalm of Praise</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        OH praise Jehovah, all ye nations; <br>
        Laud him, all ye peoples. <br>
        [2]
        For his lovingkindness is great toward us; <br>
        And the truth of Jehovah endureth for ever. <br>
        Praise ye Jehovah.
      </p>

      <h2>CXVIII</h2>

      <h2>Thanksgiving for Jehovah’s Saving Goodness</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
        OH give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; <br>
        For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.<br>
        [2]
        Let Israel now say,<br>
        That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.<br>
        [3]
        Let the house of Aaron now say,<br>
        That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.<br>
        [4]
        Let them now that fear Jehovah say,<br>
        That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.<br>
        [5]
        Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah:<br>
        Jehovah answered me and set me in a large place.<br>
        [6]
        Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear:<br>
        What can man do unto me?<br>
        [7]
        Jehovah is on my side among them that help me:<br>
        Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.<br>
        [8]
        It is better to take refuge in Jehovah<br>
        Than to put confidence in man.<br>
        [9]
        It is better to take refuge in Jehovah<br>
        Than to put confidence in princes.<br>
        [10]
        All nations compassed me about:<br>
        In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.<br>
        [11]
        They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about:<br>
        In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.<br>
        [12]
        They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns:<br>
        In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.<br>
        [13]
        Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall;<br>
        But Jehovah helped me.<br>
        [14]
        Jehovah is my strength and song;<br>
        And he is become my salvation.<br>
        [15]
        The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous:<br>
        The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.<br>
        [16]
        The right hand of Jehovah is exalted:<br>
        The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.<br>
        [17]
        I shall not die, but live,<br>
        And declare the works of Jehovah.<br>
        [18]
        Jehovah hath chastened me sore;<br>
        But he hath not given me over unto death.<br>
        [19]
        Open to me the gates of righteousness:<br>
        I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah.<br>
        [20]
        This is the gate of Jehovah;<br>
        The righteous shall enter into it.<br>
        [21]
        I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me,<br>
        And art become my salvation.<br>
        [22]
        The stone which the builders rejected<br>
        Is become the head of the corner.<br>
        [23]
        This is Jehovah’s doing;<br>
        It is marvellous in our eyes.<br>
        [24]
        This is the day which Jehovah hath made;<br>
        We will rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
        [25]
        Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah:<br>
        O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.<br>
        [26]
        Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah:<br>
        We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah.<br>
        [27]
        Jehovah is God, and he hath given us light:<br>
        Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.<br>
        [28]
        Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee:<br>
        Thou art my God, I will exalt thee.<br>
        [29]
        Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;<br>
        For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

        BLESSED are they that are perfect in the way, <br>
        Who walk in the law of Jehovah. <br>
        [2]
        Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, <br>

        Yea, they do no unrighteousness; <br>
        They walk in his ways. <br>

        Thou hast commanded us thy precepts, <br>
        That we should observe them diligently. <br>
