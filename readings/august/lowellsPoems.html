      <h2>The Courtin'</h2>

      <p>
        God makes sech nights, all white an' still <br>
        Fur 'z you can look or listen, <br>
        Moonshine an' snow on field an' hill, <br>
        All silence an' all glisten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zekle crep' up quite unbeknown<br>
        An' peeked in thru' the winder,<br>
        An' there sot Huldy all alone,<br>
        'ith no one nigh to hender.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fireplace filled the room's one side <br>
        With half a cord o' wood in — <br>
        There war n't no stoves (tell comfort died)<br>
        To bake ye to a puddin'.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wa'nut logs shot sparkles out <br>
        Towards the pootiest, bless her, <br>
        An' leetle flames danced all about <br>
        The chiny on the dresser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agin the chimbley crook-necks hung, <br>
        An' in amongst 'em rusted <br>
        The ole queen's-arm thet gran'ther Young<br>
        Fetched back f'om Concord busted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The very room, coz she was in, <br>
        Seemed warm f'om floor to ceilin', <br>
        An' she looked full ez rosy agin<br>
        Ez the apples she was peelin'.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Twas kin' o' kingdom-come to look <br>
        On sech a blessed cretur, <br>
        A dogrose blushin' to a brook<br>
        Ain't modester nor sweeter.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was six foot o' man, A 1, <br>
        Clear grit an' human natur',<br>
        None couldn't quicker pitch a ton <br>
        Nor dror a furrer straighter.
      </p>

      <p>
        He'd sparked it with full twenty gals,<br>
        Hed squired 'em, danced 'em, druv 'em, <br>
        Fust this one, an' then thet, by spells — <br>
        All is, he couldn't love 'em.
      </p>

      <p>
        But long o' her his veins 'ould run <br>
        All crinkly like curled maple,<br>
        The side she breshed felt full o' sun <br>
        Ez a south slope in Ap'il.
      </p>

      <p>
        She thought no v'ice hed sech a swing<br>
        Ez hisn in the choir;<br>
        My! when he made Ole Hunderd ring,<br>
        She knowed the Lord was nigher.
      </p>

      <p>
        An' she'd blush scarlit, right in prayer, <br>
        When her new meetin'-bunnet<br>
        Felt somehow thru' its crown a pair<br>
        O' blue eyes sot upun it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thet night, I tell ye, she looked some!<br>
        She seemed to 've gut a new soul,<br>
        For she felt sartin-sure he'd come, <br>
        Down to her very shoe-sole.
      </p>

      <p>
        She heered a foot, an' knowed it tu, <br>
        A-raspin' on the scraper, — <br>
        All ways to once her feelins flew <br>
        Like sparks in burnt-up paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        He kin' o' l'itered on the mat,<br>
        Some doubtfle o' the sekle,<br>
        His heart kep' goin' pity-pat, <br>
        But hern went pity Zekle.
      </p>

      <p>
        An' yit she gin her cheer a jerk<br>
        Ez though she wished him furder,<br>
        An' on her apples kep' to work,<br>
        Parin' away like murder.
      </p>

      <p>
        'You want to see my Pa, I s'pose?'<br>
        'Wal ... no ... I come dasignin'' - <br>
        'To see my Ma? She's sprinklin' clo'es <br>
        Agin to-morror's i'nin'.'
      </p>

      <p>
        To say why gals acts so or so,<br>
        Or don't, 'ould be persumin';<br>
        Mebby to mean yes an' say no <br>
        Comes nateral to women.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood a spell on one foot fust, <br>
        Then stood a spell on t'other,<br>
        An' on which one he felt the wust<br>
        He couldn't ha' told ye nuther.
      </p>

      <p>
        Says he, 'I'd better call agin;'<br>
        Says she, 'Think likely, Mister:'<br>
        Thet last word pricked him like a pin,<br>
        An' . . . Wal, he up an' kist her.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Ma bimeby upon 'em slips, <br>
        Huldy sot pale ez ashes, <br>
        All kin' o' smily roun' the lips<br>
        An' teary roun' the lashes.
      </p>

      <p>
        For she was jes' the quiet kind<br>
        Whose naturs never vary,<br>
        Like streams that keep a summer mind<br>
        Snowhid in Jenooary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blood clost roun' her heart felt glued<br>
        Too tight for all expressin', <br>
        Tell mother see how metters stood,<br>
        An' gin 'em both her blessin'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then her red come back like the tide <br>
        Down to the Bay o' Fundy,<br>
        An' all I know is they was cried <br>
        In meetin' come nex' Sunday.
