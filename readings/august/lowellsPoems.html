          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_Lowell" target="_blank"><em>James Russell Lowell</em></a>
           (February 22, 1819 – August 12, 1891) was an American Romantic poet,
           critic, editor, and diplomat. He is associated with the Fireside
           Poets, a group of New England writers who were among the first
           American poets that rivaled the popularity of British poets.
           These writers usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry,
           making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.
           Lowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society.
           He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism.
           He attempted to emulate the true accents in the dialogue of his
           characters, particularly in <em>The Biglow Papers</em>. This depiction of
           dialects, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers
           such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.

      <h2>The Courtin'</h2>

      <p>
        God makes sech nights, all white an' still <br>
        Fur 'z you can look or listen, <br>
        Moonshine an' snow on field an' hill, <br>
        All silence an' all glisten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zekle crep' up quite unbeknown<br>
        An' peeked in thru' the winder,<br>
        An' there sot Huldy all alone,<br>
        'ith no one nigh to hender.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fireplace filled the room's one side <br>
        With half a cord o' wood in — <br>
        There war n't no stoves (tell comfort died)<br>
        To bake ye to a puddin'.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wa'nut logs shot sparkles out <br>
        Towards the <span class="tooltip">pootiest<span class="tooltiptext">"prettiest"</span></span>, bless her, <br>
        An' leetle flames danced all about <br>
        The chiny on the dresser.
      </p>

        The very room, coz she was in, <br>
        Seemed warm f'om floor to ceilin', <br>
        An' she looked full ez rosy agin<br>
        <span class="tooltip">Ez<span class="tooltiptext">As</span></span> the apples she was peelin'.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Twas kin' o' kingdom-come to look <br>
        On sech a blessed cretur, <br>
        A dogrose blushin' to a brook<br>
        Ain't modester nor sweeter.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was six foot o' man, A 1, <br>
        Clear grit an' human natur',<br>
        None couldn't quicker pitch a ton <br>
        Nor <span class="tooltip">dror a furrer straighter<span class="tooltiptext">"draw a furrow straighter" is, metaphorically, to live uprightly or decorously</span></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He'd sparked it with full twenty gals,<br>
        Hed squired 'em, danced 'em, druv 'em, <br>
        Fust this one, an' then thet, by spells — <br>
        All is, he couldn't love 'em.
      </p>

      <p>
        But long o' her his veins 'ould run <br>
        All crinkly like curled maple,<br>
        The side she breshed felt full o' sun <br>
        Ez a south slope in Ap'il.
      </p>

      <p>
        She thought no v'ice hed sech a swing<br>
        Ez hisn in the choir;<br>
        My! when he made <span class="tooltip">Ole Hunderd<span class="tooltiptext">"Old 100th" is a hymn tune that is is one of the best known melodies in all Christian musical traditions</span></span> ring,<br>
        She knowed the Lord was nigher.
      </p>

      <p>
        An' she'd blush scarlit, right in prayer, <br>
        When her new meetin'-bunnet<br>
        Felt somehow thru' its crown a pair<br>
        O' blue eyes sot upun it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thet night, I tell ye, she looked some!<br>
        She seemed to 've gut a new soul,<br>
        For she felt <span class="tooltip">sartin<span class="tooltiptext">certain</span></span>-sure he'd come, <br>
        Down to her very shoe-sole.
      </p>

      <p>
        She heered a foot, an' knowed it tu, <br>
        A-raspin' on the scraper, — <br>
        All ways to once her feelins flew <br>
        Like sparks in burnt-up paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        He kin' o' l'itered on the mat,<br>
        Some doubtfle o' the sekle,<br>
        His heart kep' goin' pity-pat, <br>
        But hern went pity Zekle.
      </p>

      <p>
        An' yit she <span class="tooltip">gin<span class="tooltiptext">gave</span></span> her cheer a jerk<br>
        Ez though she wished him <span class="tooltip">furder<span class="tooltiptext">farther</span></span>,<br>
        An' on her apples kep' to work,<br>
        Parin' away like murder.
      </p>

      <p>
        'You want to see my Pa, I s'pose?'<br>
        'Wal ... no ... I come dasignin'' - <br>
        'To see my Ma? She's sprinklin' clo'es <br>
        Agin to-morror's i'nin'.'
      </p>

      <p>
        To say why gals acts so or so,<br>
        Or don't, 'ould be persumin';<br>
        Mebby to mean yes an' say no <br>
        Comes nateral to women.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood a spell on one foot fust, <br>
        Then stood a spell on t'other,<br>
        An' on which one he felt the wust<br>
        He couldn't ha' told ye nuther.
      </p>

      <p>
        Says he, 'I'd better call agin;'<br>
        Says she, 'Think likely, Mister:'<br>
        Thet last word pricked him like a pin,<br>
        An' . . . Wal, he up an' kist her.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Ma <span class="tooltip">bimeby<span class="tooltiptext">By and by</span></span> upon 'em slips, <br>
        Huldy sot pale ez ashes, <br>
        All kin' o' smily roun' the lips<br>
        An' teary roun' the lashes.
      </p>

      <p>
        For she was jes' the quiet kind<br>
        Whose naturs never vary,<br>
        Like streams that keep a summer mind<br>
        Snowhid in Jenooary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blood clost roun' her heart felt glued<br>
        Too tight for all expressin', <br>
        Tell mother see how metters stood,<br>
        An' gin 'em both her blessin'.
      </p>

        Down to the <span class="tooltip">Bay o' Fundy<span class="tooltiptext">A bay known for extremely high tides</span></span>,<br>
        An' all I know is they was cried <br>
        In meetin' come nex' Sunday.
