      <h2>Song—Auld Lang Syne</h2>

      <p>
        SHOULD auld acquaintance be forgot, <br>
          And never brought to mind?<br>
        Should auld acquaintance be forgot,<br>
          And auld lang syne!
      </p>

      <p>
        Chorus.—For auld lang syne, my dear,<br>
          For auld lang syne.<br>
        We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,<br>
          For auld lang syne.
      </p>

      <p>
        And surely ye’ll be your pint stowp!<br>
          And surely I’ll be mine!<br>
        And we’ll tak a cup o’kindness yet,<br>
          For auld lang syne.<br>
                For auld, &c.
      </p>

      <p>
        We twa hae run about the braes,<br>
          And pou’d the gowans fine;<br>
        But we’ve wander’d mony a weary fit,<br>
          Sin’ auld lang syne.<br>
                For auld, &c.
      </p>

      <p>
        We twa hae paidl’d in the burn,<br>
          Frae morning sun till dine;<br>
        But seas between us braid hae roar’d<br>
          Sin’ auld lang syne.<br>
                For auld, &c.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there’s a hand, my trusty fere!<br>
          And gie’s a hand o’ thine!<br>
        And we’ll tak a right gude-willie waught,<br>
          For auld lang syne.<br>
                For auld, &c.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—My Bonie Bell</h2>

      <p>
        THE SMILING Spring comes in rejoicing,<br>
          And surly Winter grimly flies;<br>
        Now crystal clear are the falling waters,<br>
          And bonie blue are the sunny skies.<br>
        Fresh o’er the mountains breaks forth the morning,<br>
          The ev’ning gilds the ocean’s swell;<br>
        All creatures joy in the sun’s returning,<br>
          And I rejoice in my bonie Bell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flowery Spring leads sunny Summer,<br>
          The yellow Autumn presses near;<br>
        Then in his turn comes gloomy Winter,<br>
          Till smiling Spring again appear:<br>
        Thus seasons dancing, life advancing,<br>
          Old Time and Nature their changes tell;<br>
        But never ranging, still unchanging,<br>
          I adore my bonie Bell.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—Fragment—Love for love</h2>

      <p>
        ITHERS seek they ken na what,<br>
        Features, carriage, and a’ that;<br>
        Gie me love in her I court,<br>
        Love to love maks a’ the sport.<br>
        Let love sparkle in her e’e;<br>
        Let her lo’e nae man but me;<br>
        That’s the tocher-gude I prize,<br>
        There the luver’s treasure lies.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—A Man’s a Man for a’ that</h2>

      <h3>Tune—“For a’ that.”</h3>

      <p>
        IS there for honest Poverty<br>
          That hings his head, an’ a’ that;<br>
        The coward slave-we pass him by,<br>
          We dare be poor for a’ that!<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that.<br>
          Our toils obscure an’ a’ that,<br>
        The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,<br>
          The Man’s the gowd for a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        What though on hamely fare we dine,<br>
          Wear hoddin grey, an’ a that;<br>
        Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;<br>
          A Man’s a Man for a’ that:<br>
        For a’ that, and a’ that,<br>
          Their tinsel show, an’ a’ that;<br>
        The honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor,<br>
          Is king o’ men for a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ye see yon birkie, ca’d a lord,<br>
          Wha struts, an’ stares, an’ a’ that;<br>
        Tho’ hundreds worship at his word,<br>
          He’s but a coof for a’ that:<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that,<br>
          His ribband, star, an’ a’ that:<br>
        The man o’ independent mind<br>
          He looks an’ laughs at a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        A prince can mak a belted knight,<br>
          A marquis, duke, an’ a’ that;<br>
        But an honest man’s abon his might,<br>
          Gude faith, he maunna fa’ that!<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that,<br>
          Their dignities an’ a’ that;<br>
        The pith o’ sense, an’ pride o’ worth,<br>
          Are higher rank than a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then let us pray that come it may,<br>
          (As come it will for a’ that,)<br>
        That Sense and Worth, o’er a’ the earth,<br>
          Shall bear the gree, an’ a’ that.<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that,<br>
          It’s coming yet for a’ that,<br>
        That Man to Man, the world o’er,<br>
          Shall brothers be for a’ that.
