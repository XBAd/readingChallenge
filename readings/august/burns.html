        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" target="_blank"><em>Robert Burns</em></a> (25 January 1759 – 21 July 1796)
          was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.
          He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature.

      <h2>Song—Auld Lang Syne</h2>

      <p>
        SHOULD <span class="tooltip">auld<span class="tooltiptext">old</span></span> acquaintance be forgot, <br>
          And never brought to mind?<br>

      <p>
        Chorus.—For auld lang syne, my dear,<br>
          For auld lang syne.<br>
        We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,<br>
          For auld lang syne.

      <h2>Song—My Bonie Bell</h2>

      <p>
        THE SMILING Spring comes in rejoicing,<br>
          And surly Winter grimly flies;<br>
        Now crystal clear are the falling waters,<br>
          And <span class="tooltip">bonie<span class="tooltiptext">comes from the Scottish word "bonnie" meaning "pretty, attractive", or the French bonne (good) as a way to describe a fair, good and beautiful girl. That is in turn derived from the Latin word "bonus" meaning good.</span></span> blue are the sunny skies.<br>
        Fresh o’er the mountains breaks forth the morning,<br>
          The ev’ning gilds the ocean’s swell;<br>
        All creatures joy in the sun’s returning,<br>
          And I rejoice in my bonie Bell.
      </p>

      <p>
        The flowery Spring leads sunny Summer,<br>
          The yellow Autumn presses near;<br>
        Then in his turn comes gloomy Winter,<br>
          Till smiling Spring again appear:<br>
        Thus seasons dancing, life advancing,<br>
          Old Time and Nature their changes tell;<br>
        But never ranging, still unchanging,<br>
          I adore my bonie Bell.
      </p>

      <h2>Song—Fragment—Love for love</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="tooltip">ITHERS<span class="tooltiptext">dialectal British variant of others</span></span> seek they ken na what,<br>
        Features, carriage, and a’ that;<br>
        Gie me love in her I court,<br>
        Love to love maks a’ the sport.<br>
        Let love sparkle in her e’e;<br>
        Let her lo’e nae man but me;<br>
        That’s the <span class="tooltip">tocher<span class="tooltiptext">a dowry; marriage settlement given to the groom by the bride or her family</span></span>-gude I prize,<br>
        There the luver’s treasure lies.

      <h2>Song—A Man’s a Man for a’ that</h2>

      <h3>Tune—“For a’ that.”</h3>

      <p>
        IS there for honest Poverty<br>
          That hings his head, an’ a’ that;<br>
        The coward slave-we pass him by,<br>
          We dare be poor for a’ that!<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that.<br>
          Our toils obscure an’ a’ that,<br>
        The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,<br>
          The Man’s the <span class="tooltip">gowd<span class="tooltiptext">Scottish variant of gold</span></span> for a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        What though on hamely fare we dine,<br>
          Wear <span class="tooltip">hoddin<span class="tooltiptext">a coarse homespun cloth produced in Scotland: hodden grey is made by mixing black and white wools.</span></span> grey, an’ a that;<br>
        Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;<br>
          A Man’s a Man for a’ that:<br>
        For a’ that, and a’ that,<br>
          Their tinsel show, an’ a’ that;<br>
        The honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor,<br>
          Is king o’ men for a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ye see yon <span class="tooltip">birkie<span class="tooltiptext">a lively smart assertive person</span></span>, ca’d a lord,<br>
          Wha struts, an’ stares, an’ a’ that;<br>
        Tho’ hundreds worship at his word,<br>
          He’s but a <span class="tooltip">coof<span class="tooltiptext">a stupid fellow</span></span> for a’ that:<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that,<br>
          His <span class="tooltip">ribband<span class="tooltiptext">A long, narrow strip of timber bent and bolted longitudinally to the ribs of a vessel, to hold them in position and give rigidity to the framework.</span></span>, star, an’ a’ that:<br>
        The man o’ independent mind<br>
          He looks an’ laughs at a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        A prince can mak a belted knight,<br>
          A marquis, duke, an’ a’ that;<br>
        But an honest man’s abon his might,<br>
          Gude faith, he maunna fa’ that!<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that,<br>
          Their dignities an’ a’ that;<br>
        The pith o’ sense, an’ pride o’ worth,<br>
          Are higher rank than a’ that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then let us pray that come it may,<br>
          (As come it will for a’ that,)<br>
        That Sense and Worth, o’er a’ the earth,<br>
          Shall bear the <span class="tooltip">gree<span class="tooltiptext">superiority, preeminence, or victory</span></span>, an’ a’ that.<br>
        For a’ that, an’ a’ that,<br>
          It’s coming yet for a’ that,<br>
        That Man to Man, the world o’er,<br>
          Shall brothers be for a’ that.
