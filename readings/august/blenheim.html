      <h2>ROBERT SOUTHEY</h2>
      <h3>[1774 - 1843]</h3>
      <h3>After Blenheim</h3>

      <p>
        It was a summer evening, <br>
        Old Kaspar's work was done, <br>
        And he before his cottage door<br>
        Was sitting in the sun; <br>
        And by him sported on the green <br>
        His little grandchild Wilhelmine.
      </p>

      <p>
        She saw her brother Peterkin<br>
        Roll something large and round<br>
        Which he beside the rivulet <br>
        In playing there had found;<br>
        He came to ask what he had found<br>
        That was so large and smooth and round.
      </p>

      <p>
        Old Kaspar took it from the boy<br>
        Who stood expectant by;<br>
        And then the old man shook his head,<br>
        And with a natural sigh<br>
        "Tis some poor fellow's skull,' said he.<br>
        'Who fell in the great victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        'I find them in the garden, <br>
        For there's many here about;<br>
        And often when I go to plough<br>
        The ploughshare turns them out. <br>
        For many thousand men,' said he,<br>
        'Were slain in that great victory.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'Now tell us what 'twas all about,'<br>
        Young Peterkin he cries; <br>
        And little Wilhelmine looks up<br>
        With wonder-waiting eyes; <br>
        'Now tell us all about the war, <br>
        And what they fought each other for.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'It was the English,' Kaspar cried,<br>
        'Who put the French to rout; <br>
        But what they fought each other for<br>
        I could not well make out. <br>
        But everybody said,' quoth he, <br>
        'That 'twas a famous victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        'My father lived at Blenheim then, <br>
        Yon little stream hard by;<br>
        They burnt his dwelling to the ground,<br>
        And he was forced to fly: <br>
        So with his wife and child he fled,<br>
        Nor had he where to rest his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        'With fire and sword the country round<br>
        Was wasted far and wide,<br>
        And many a childing mother then <br>
        And newborn baby died: <br>
        But things like that, you know, must be <br>
        At every famous victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        'They say it was a shocking sight <br>
        After the field was won;<br>
        For many thousand bodies here <br>
        Lay rotting in the sun: <br>
        But things like that, you know, must be<br>
        After a famous victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won <br>
        And our good Prince Eugene;'<br>
        'Why 'twas a very wicked thing!' <br>
        Said little Wilhelmine;<br>
        'Nay . . nay . . my little girl,' quoth he,<br>
        'It was a famous victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        'And every body praised the Duke<br>
        Who this great fight did win.'<br>
        'But what good came of it at last?' <br>
        Quoth little Peterkin: â€” <br>
        'Why that I cannot tell,' said he, <br>
        'But 'twas a famous victory.'
      </p>

      <h3>THE SCHOLAR</h3>

      <p>
        My days among the Dead are past; <br>
        Around me I behold,<br>
        Where'er these casual eyes are cast, <br>
        The mighty minds of old: <br>
        My never-failing friends are they,<br>
        With whom I converse day by day.
      </p>

      <p>
        With them I take delight in weal<br>
        And seek relief in woe; <br>
        And while I understand and feel <br>
        How much to them I owe,<br>
        My cheeks have often been bedew'd<br>
        With tears of thoughtful gratitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        My thoughts are with the Dead; with them <br>
        I live in long-past years, <br>
        Their virtues love, their faults condemn,<br>
        Partake their hopes and fears, <br>
        And from their lessons seek and find <br>
        Instruction with an humble mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        My hopes are with the Dead; anon <br>
        My place with them will be,<br>
        And I with them shall travel on <br>
        Through all Futurity; <br>
        Yet leaving here a name, I trust, <br>
        That will not perish in the dust.
