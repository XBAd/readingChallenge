          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo" target="_blank"><em>Phaedo</em></a>
          , also known to ancient readers as <em>On The Soul</em>, is one of the
          best-known dialogues of Plato's middle period, along with the <em>Republic</em>
           and the <em>Symposium</em>. The philosophical subject of the dialogue
           is the immortality of the soul. It is set in the last hours prior to
           the death of Socrates, and is Plato's fourth and last dialogue to
           detail the philosopher's final days, following <em>Euthyphro</em>, <em>Apology</em>, and <em>Crito</em>.
           One of the main themes in the Phaedo is the idea that the soul is immortal.
           In the dialogue, Socrates discusses the nature of the afterlife
           on his last day before being executed by drinking hemlock.
           Socrates has been imprisoned and sentenced to death by an Athenian
           jury for not believing in the gods of the state (though some scholars
           think it was more for his support of "philosopher kings" as opposed to
           democracy) and for corrupting the youth of the city. By engaging in
           dialectic with a group of Socrates' friends, including the two Thebans,
           Cebes, and Simmias, Socrates explores various arguments for the soul's
           immortality in order to show that there is an afterlife in which the
           soul will dwell following death. Phaedo tells the story that following
           the discussion, he and the others were there to witness the death of
           Socrates. The Phaedo was first translated into Latin from Greek by
           Henry Aristippus in 1160. Today, it is generally considered one of
           Plato's great works.

      <h2>PHÆDO</h2>

      <h3>PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE</h3>
      <h4>Phædo, who is the narrator of the dialogue to Echecrates Simmias of Phlius</h4>
      <h4>Socrates</h4>
      <h4>Apollodorus</h4>
      <h4>Simmias</h4>
      <h4>Cebes</h4>
      <h4>Crito</h4>
      <h4>Attendant of the Prison</h4>

      <h3>Scene: The Prison of Socrates</h3>
      <h3>Place of the Narration: Phlius</h3>

      <p>
        <em>Echecrates</em> Were you yourself, Phædo, in the prison with Socrates on
the day when he drank the poison?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phædo.</em> Yes, Echecrates, I was.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> I wish that you would tell me about his death. What did he
say in his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking
poison, but no one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever
goes to Athens now, and a long time has elapsed since any Athenian
found his way to Phlius, and therefore we had no clear account.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> Did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> Yes; someone told us about the trial, and we could not understand why, having been condemned, he was put to death, as appeared, not at the time, but long afterwards. What was the reason
of this?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> An accident, Echecrates. The reason was that the stern of
the ship which the Athenians send to Delos happened to have been
crowned on the day before he was tried.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> What is this ship?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> This is the ship in which, as the Athenians say, Theseus
went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was
the saviour of them and of himself. And they were said to have
vowed to Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would make an annual pilgrimage to Delos. Now this custom still continues,
and the whole period of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is not allowed to be polluted
by public executions; and often, when the vessel is detained by
adverse winds, there may be a very considerable delay. As I was
saying, the ship was crowned on the day before the trial, and this was the reason why Socrates lay in prison and was not put to death
until long after he was condemned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> What was the manner of his death, Phædo? What was said or done? And which of his friends had he with him? Or were
they not allowed by the authorities to be present? And did he die alone?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> No; there were several of his friends with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell me
what passed, as exactly as you can.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> I have nothing to do, and will try to gratify your wish.
For to me, too, there is no greater pleasure than to have Socrates brought to my recollection, whether I speak myself or hear another
speak of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> You will have listeners who are of the same mind with you, and I hope that you will be as exact as you can.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> I remember the strange feeling which came over me at being with him. For I could hardly believe that I was present at the death of a friend, and therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; his <span class="tooltip">mien<span class="tooltiptext">a person's look or manner, especially one of a particular kind indicating their character or mood.</span></span> and his language were so noble and fearless in the hour of death that to me he appeared blessed. I thought that in going to the Other world he could not be without a divine call, and that he would
be happy, if any man ever was, when he arrived there, and therefore
I did not pity him as might seem natural at such a time. But neither could I feel the pleasure which I usually felt in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme of which we spoke). I was
pleased, and I was also pained, because I knew that he was soon to
die, and this strange mixture of feeling was shared by us all; we
were laughing and weeping by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus — you
know the sort of man?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> Yes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> He was quite overcome; and I myself and all of us were
greatly moved.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> Who were present?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus,
Critobulus and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Æschines,
and Antisthenes; likewise Ctesippus of the <span class="tooltip">deme<span class="tooltiptext">a political division of Attica in ancient Greece.</span></span> of Pæania, Menexenus,
and some others; but Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> Were there any strangers?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and
Phædondes; Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> No, they were said to be in Ægina.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> Anyone else?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> I think that these were about all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ech.</em> And what was the discourse of which you spoke?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Phæd.</em> I will begin at the beginning, and endeavor to repeat the
entire conversation. You must understand that we had been previously
in the habit of assembling early in the morning at the court
in which the trial was held, and which is not far from the prison.
There we remained talking with one another until the opening of
the prison doors (for they were not opened very early), and then
went in and generally passed the day with Socrates. On the last morning the meeting was earlier than usual; this was owing to our
having heard on the previous evening that the sacred ship had
arrived from Delos, and therefore we agreed to meet very early at the accustomed place. On our going to the prison, the jailer who
answered the door, instead of admitting us, came out and bade
us wait and he would call us. "For the Eleven," he said, "are now
with Socrates; they are taking off his chains, and giving orders that he is to die to-day." He soon returned and said that we might come
in. On entering we found Socrates just released from chains, and
Xanthippe, whom you know, sitting by him, and holding his child
in her arms. When she saw us she uttered a cry and said, as women
will: "O Socrates, this is the last time that either you will converse with your friends, or they with you." Socrates turned to Crito and
said: "Crito, let someone take her home." Some of Crito's people
accordingly led her away, crying out and beating herself. And when she was gone, Socrates, sitting up on the couch, began to bend
and rub his leg, saying, as he rubbed: "How singular is the thing
called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be
thought to be the opposite of it; for they never come to a man
together, and yet he who pursues either of them is generally compelled
to take the other. They are two, and yet they grow together out of one head or stem; and I cannot help thinking that if Æsop
had noticed them, he would have made a fable about God trying
to reconcile their strife, and when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is the reason why when one comes the other follows, as I find in my own case pleasure comes following
after the pain in my leg, which was caused by the chain."
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon this Cebes said: I am very glad indeed, Socrates, that you
mentioned the name of Æsop. For that reminds me of a question
which has been asked by others, and was asked of me only the day
before yesterday by Evenus the poet, and as he will be sure to ask
again, you may as well tell me what I should say to him, if you
would like him to have an answer. He wanted to know why you
who never before wrote a line of poetry, now that you are in prison are putting Æsop into verse, and also composing that hymn in honor of Apollo.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tell him, Cebes, he replied, that I had no idea of rivalling him or
his poems; which is the truth, for I knew that I could not do that. But I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which
I felt about certain dreams. In the course of my life I have often had intimations in dreams "that I should make music." The same dream came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another,
but always saying the same or nearly the same words: Make
and cultivate music, said the dream. And hitherto I had imagined
that this was only intended to exhort and encourage me in the study
of philosophy, which has always been the pursuit of my life, and
is the noblest and best of music. The dream was bidding me to do
what I was already doing, in the same way that the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he is already running.
But I was not certain of this, as the dream might have meant music
in the popular sense of the word, and being under sentence of
death, and the festival giving me a respite, I thought that I should be safer if I satisfied the scruple, and, in obedience to the dream,
composed a few verses before I departed. And first I made a hymn
in honor of the god of the festival, and then considering that a poet,
if he is really to be a poet or maker, should not only put words
together but make stories, and as I have no invention, I took some
fables of Æsop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned
them into verse. Tell Evenus this, and bid him be of good cheer;
say that I would have him come after me if he be a wise man, and
not <span class="tooltip">tarry<span class="tooltiptext">stay longer than intended; delay leaving a place.</span></span>; and that today I am likely to be going, for the Athenians
say that I must.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simmias said: What a message for such a man! having been a
frequent companion of his, I should say that, as far as I know him,
he will never take your advice unless he is obliged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why, said Socrates, — is not Evenus a philosopher?
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that he is, said Simmias.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be
willing to die, though he will not take his own life, for that is held
not to be right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on
to the ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained
sitting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why do you say, inquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying?
      </p>

      <p>
        Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are acquainted with Philolaus, never heard him speak of this?
      </p>

      <p>
        I never understood him, Socrates.
      </p>

      <p>
        My words, too, are only an echo; but I am very willing to say what I have heard: and indeed, as I am going to another place, I ought to be thinking and talking of the nature of the pilgrimage
which I am about to make. What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?
      </p>

      <p>
        Then tell me, Socrates, why is suicide held not to be right? as I have certainly heard Philolaus affirm when he was staying with us
at Thebes: and there are others who say the same, although none of
them has ever made me understand him.
      </p>

      <p>
        But do your best, replied Socrates, and the day may come when
you will understand. I suppose that you wonder why, as most things which are evil may be accidentally good, this is to be the only exception (for may not death, too, be better than life in some
cases?), and why, when a man is better dead, he is not permitted
to be his own benefactor, but must wait for the hand of another.
      </p>

      <p>
        By Jupiter! yes, indeed, said Cebes, laughing, and speaking in his native Doric.
      </p>

      <p>
        I admit the appearance of inconsistency, replied Socrates, but
there may not be any real inconsistency after all in this. There is a doctrine uttered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and run away; this is a great mystery
which I do not quite understand. Yet I, too, believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we are a possession of theirs. Do you
not agree?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, I agree to that, said Cebes.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example
took the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had
given no intimation of your wish that he should die, would you
not be angry with him, and would you not punish him if you could?
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly, replied Cebes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then there may be reason in saying that a man should wait, and
not take his own life until God summons him, as he is now
summoning me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there is surely reason in that. And yet
how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our
guardian and we his possessions, with that willingness to die which we were attributing to the philosopher? That the wisest of men
should be willing to leave this service in which they are ruled by
the gods who are the best of rulers is not reasonable, for surely no
wise man thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself than the gods take of him. A fool may perhaps think
this — he may argue that he had better run away from his master, not considering that his duty is to remain to the end, and not to run away from the good, and that there is no sense in his running
away. But the wise man will want to be ever with him who is
better than himself. Now this, Socrates, is the reverse of what was
just now said; for upon this view the wise man should sorrow and
the fool rejoice at passing out of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said
he, turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not to be convinced all in a moment, nor by every argument.
      </p>

      <p>
        And in this case, added Simmias, his objection does appear to me
to have some force. For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself? And I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you;
he thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave
the gods who, as you acknowledge, are our good rulers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in that. And this indictment
you think that I ought to answer as if I were in court?
      </p>

      <p>
        That is what we should like, said Simmias.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I must try to make a better impression upon you than I did when defending myself before the judges. For I am quite ready
to acknowledge, Simmias and Cebes, that I ought to be grieved at
death, if I were not persuaded that I am going to other gods who
are wise and good (of this I am as certain as I can be of anything
of the sort) and to men departed (though I am not so certain of
this), who are better than those whom I leave behind; and therefore
I do not grieve as I might have done, for I have good hope
that there is yet something remaining for the dead, and, as has
been said of old, some far better thing for the good than for the evil.
      </p>

      <p>
        But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates?
said Simmias. Will you not communicate them to us? — the benefit
is one in which we too may hope to share. Moreover, if you succeed
in convincing us, that will be an answer to the charge against
yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let me hear
what Crito wants; he was going to say something to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only this, Socrates, replied Crito: the attendant who is to give
you the poison has been telling me that you are not to talk much,
and he wants me to let you know this; for that by talking heat is
increased, and this interferes with the action of the poison; those who excite themselves are sometimes obliged to drink the poison
two or three times.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared
to give the poison two or three times, if necessary; that is all I was almost certain that you would say that, replied Crito; but
I was obliged to satisfy him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never mind him, he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now I will make answer to you, O my judges, and show
that he who has lived as a true philosopher has reason to be of good
cheer when he is about to die, and that after death he may hope to receive the greatest good in the other world. And how this may be,
Simmias and Cebes, I will endeavor to explain. For I deem that the true disciple of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do not perceive that he is ever pursuing death and dying;
and if this is true, why, having had the desire of death all his life long, should he <span class="tooltip">repine<span class="tooltiptext">feel or express discontent; fret.</span></span> at the arrival of that which he has been
always pursuing and desiring?
      </p>

      <p>
        Simmias laughed and said: Though not in a laughing humor, I swear that I cannot help laughing when I think what the wicked
world will say when they hear this. They will say that this is very
true, and our people at home will agree with them in saying that the life which philosophers desire is truly death, and that they have
found them out to be deserving of the death which they desire.
      </p>

      <p>
        And they are right, Simmias, in saying this, with the exception
of the words "They have found them out"; for they have not found
out what is the nature of this death which the true philosopher
desires, or how he deserves or desires death. But let us leave them
and have a word with ourselves: Do we believe that there is such
a thing as death?
      </p>

      <p>
        To be sure, replied Simmias.
      </p>

      <p>
        And is this anything but the separation of soul and body? And
being dead is the attainment of this separation; when the soul exists in herself, and is parted from the body and the body is parted from
the soul — that is death?
      </p>

      <p>
        Exactly: that and nothing else, he replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what do you say of another question, my friend, about which
I should like to have your opinion, and the answer to which will probably throw light on our present inquiry: Do you think that the philosopher ought to care about the pleasures — if they are to be
called pleasures — of eating and drinking?
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly not, answered Simmias.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what do you say of the pleasures of love — should he care about them?
      </p>

      <p>
        By no means.
      </p>

      <p>
        And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body —
for example, the acquisition of costly <span class="tooltip">raiment<span class="tooltiptext">clothing.</span></span>, or sandals, or other
adornments of the body? Instead of caring about them, does he not
rather despise anything more than nature needs? What do you say?
      </p>

      <p>
        I should say the true philosopher would despise them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body? He would like, as far as he can, to be quit
of the body and turn to the soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be
observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the body.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that a life which has no bodily pleasures and no part in them is not worth
having; but that he who thinks nothing of bodily pleasures is almost
as though he were dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is quite true.
      </p>

      <p>
        What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge? — is
the body, if invited to share in the inquiry, a hinderer or
a helper? I mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them?
Are they not, as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses?
and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other senses? — for you will allow that they are the best of
them?
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly, he replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then when does the soul attain truth? — for in attempting to consider
anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, that is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then must not existence be revealed to her in thought, if at all?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>

      <p>
        And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and
none of these things trouble her — neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any pleasure — when she has as little as possible to do with the
body, and has no bodily sense or feeling, but is aspiring after being?
      </p>

      <p>
        That is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        And in this the philosopher dishonors the body; his soul runs away from the body and desires to be alone and by herself?
      </p>

      <p>
        That is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there or is there not an absolute justice?
      </p>

      <p>
        Assuredly there is.
      </p>

      <p>
        And an absolute beauty and absolute good?
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense? (and
I speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and
strength, and of the essence or true nature of everything). Has the
reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs? or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as
to have the most exact conception of the essence of that which he
considers?
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he attains to the knowledge of them in their highest purity
who goes to each of them with the mind alone, not allowing when
in the act of thought the intrusion or introduction of sight or any
other sense in the company of reason, but with the very light of the mind in her clearness penetrates into the very light of truth in each;
he has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and of the whole
body, which he conceives of only as a disturbing element, hindering
the soul from the acquisition of knowledge when in company with
her — is not this the sort of man who, if ever man did, is likely to attain the knowledge of existence?
      </p>

      <p>
        There is admirable truth in that, Socrates, replied Simmias.
