        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid" target="_blank">The Aeneid</a>
          is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC,
          that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy,
          where he became the ancestor of the Romans.
          It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter (a rhythmic scheme in poetry).
          The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings
          from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans'
          ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and
          his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed.
          Virgil fashioned the Aeneid into a compelling founding myth or national epic
          that tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic Wars,
          glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimized the Julio-Claudian
          dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.

        "Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar, <br>
        Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war: <br>
        The noise approaches, tho' our palace stood <br>
        Aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood. <br>
        Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms <br>
        Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms. <br>
        Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay, <br>
        But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, <br>
        And hearken what the frightful sounds convey. <br>
        Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne, <br>
        Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; <br>
        Or deluges, descending on the plains, <br>
        Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains <br>
        Of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains; <br>
        Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away <br>
        Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey: <br>
        The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far <br>
        The wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war. <br>
        Then <span class="tooltip">Hector<span class="tooltiptext">In Greek mythology and Roman mythology, Hector was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War</span></span>'s faith was manifesdy clear'd, <br>
        And Grecian frauds in open light appear'd. <br>
        The palace of <span class="tooltip">Deïphobus<span class="tooltiptext">a prince of Troy</span></span> ascends<br>
        In smoky flames, and catches on his friends. <br>
        <span class="tooltip">Ucalegon<span class="tooltiptext">one of the Elders of Troy, whose house was set on fire by the Achaeans when they sacked the city.</span></span> burns next: the seas are bright<br>
        With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light. <br>
        New clamors and new clangors now arise, <br>
        The sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries. <br>
        With frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' alarms, <br>
        Resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms,<br>
        But first to gather friends, with them t' oppose<br>
        (If fortune favor'd) and repel the foes; <br>
        Spurr'd by my courage, by my country fir'd, <br>
        With sense of honor and revenge inspir'd.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name, <br>
        Had scap'd the Grecian swords, and pass'd the flame: <br>
        With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,<br>
        And by the hand his tender grandson led. <br>
        'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run? <br>
        Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?'<br>
        Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan: <br>
        'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!<br>
        The fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come,<br>
        When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom<br>
        Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands. <br>
        The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;<br>
        And armed hosts, an unexpected force, <br>
        Break from the bowels of the fatal horse. <br>
        Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about <br>
        The flames; and foes for entrance press without,<br>
        With thousand others, whom I fear to name,<br>
        More than from Argos or Mycenæ came. <br>
        To sev'ral posts their parties they divide;<br>
        Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:<br>
        The bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise;<br>
        Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies. <br>
        The <span class="tooltip">warders<span class="tooltiptext">a guard in a prison.</span></span> of the gate but scarce maintain<br>
        Th' unequal combat, and resist in vain.'
      </p>

      <p>
        "I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires, <br>
        Prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires <br>
        To run where clashing arms and clamor calls, <br>
        And rush undaunted to defend the walls. <br>
        Ripheus and Iph'itus by my side engage, <br>
        For valor one renown'd, and one for age. <br>
        Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew<br>
        My motions and my <span class="tooltip">mien<span class="tooltiptext">a person's look or manner, especially one of a particular kind indicating their character or mood.</span></span>, and to my party drew;<br>
        With young Corœbus, who by love was led <br>
        To win renown and fair Cassandra's bed,<br>
        And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid,<br>
        Forewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid.<br>
        Whom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall, <br>
        And that one spirit animated all: <br>
        'Brave souls!' said I, — 'but brave, alas! in vain — <br>
        Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain. <br>
        You see the desp'rate state of our affairs,<br>
        And heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs.<br>
        The passive gods behold the Greeks defile <br>
        Their temples, and abandon to the spoil <br>
        Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<br>
        To save a sinking town, involv'd in fire. <br>
        Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: <br>
        Despair of life the means of living shows.<br>
        So bold a speech incourag'd their desire <br>
        Of death, and added fuel to their fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        "As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, <br>
        Scour thro' the fields, nor fear the stormy night — <br>
        Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food,<br>
        And long to temper their dry chaps in blood — <br>
        So rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to die,<br>
        Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try. <br>
        We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare <br>
        Th' unequal combat in the public square: <br>
        Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<br>
        What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<br>
        What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? <br>
        An ancient and imperial city falls: <br>
        The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals; <br>
        Houses and holy temples float in blood,<br>
        And hostile nations make a common flood. <br>
        Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<br>
        The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn. <br>
        Ours take new courage from despair and night:<br>
        Confus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight. <br>
        All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears; <br>
        And grisly Death in <span class="tooltip">sundry<span class="tooltiptext">several</span></span> shapes appears. <br>
        Androgeos fell among us, with his band, <br>
        Who thought us Grecians newly come to land. <br>
        'From whence,' said he, 'my friends, this long delay?<br>
        You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<br>
        Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<br>
        And you, like truants, come too late ashore.'<br>
        He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<br>
        Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:<br>
        Amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight;<br>
        But we, more num'rous, intercept his flight.<br>
        As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,<br>
        Has with unwary footing press'd a snake;<br>
        He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies<br>
        His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; <br>
        So from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies. <br>
        In vain; for him and his we compass'd round,<br>
        Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground,<br>
        And of their lives an easy conquest found. <br>
        Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd. <br>
        Corœbus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd,<br>
        Swoln with success, and of a daring mind,<br>
        This new invention fatally design'd.<br>
        'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way,<br>
        'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey.<br>
        For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd,<br>
        But their destruction, and the Trojans' good? <br>
        Then change we shields, and their devices bear: <br>
        Let fraud supply the want of force in war. <br>
        They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd <br>
        In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,<br>
        His painted buckler, and his plumy crest. <br>
        Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<br>
        Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain. <br>
        Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<br>
        Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage; <br>
        Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<br>
        And strew with Grecian carcasses the street. <br>
        Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,<br>
        Some to the shore and safer ships retreat; <br>
        And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear, <br>
        Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.
      </p>

      <p>
        "But, ah! what use of valor can be made,<br>
        When heav'n's <span class="tooltip">propitious<span class="tooltiptext">giving or indicating a good chance of success; favorable.</span></span> pow'rs refuse their aid! <br>
        Behold the royal prophetess, the fair <br>
        Cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair,<br>
        Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,<br>
        In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands: <br>
        On heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried - <br>
        Twas all she could — her tender arms were tied. <br>
        So sad a sight Corœbus could not bear; <br>
        But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair,<br>
        Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew: <br>
        Our leader's rash example we pursue. <br>
        But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,<br>
        Pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight:<br>
        We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow,<br>
        Who thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show.<br>
        They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;<br>
        And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie. <br>
        Then, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see <br>
        Their troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free, <br>
        The Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite, <br>
        With fury charge us, and renew the fight.<br>
        The brother kings with Ajax join their force,<br>
        And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,<br>
        Contending for the kingdom of the sky,<br>
        South, east, and west, on airy <span class="tooltip">coursers<span class="tooltiptext">a swift horse.</span></span> borne;<br>
        The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: <br>
        Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,<br>
        And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies - <br>
        The troops we squander'd first again appear <br>
        From several quarters, and enclose the rear. <br>
        They first observe, and to the rest betray,<br>
        Our diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey. <br>
        Oppress'd with odds, we fall; Corœbus first,<br>
        At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd.<br>
        Then Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight;<br>
        Just of his word, observant of the right:<br>
        Heav'n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,<br>
        With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends. <br>
        Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands<br>
        Of awful Phœbus, sav'd from impious hands. <br>
        Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,<br>
        What I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there;<br>
        No sword avoiding in the fatal strife, <br>
        Expos'd to death, and <span class="tooltip">prodigal<span class="tooltiptext">having or giving something on a lavish scale.</span></span> of life; <br>
        Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:<br>
        I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought.<br>
        But, when I could not fight, and would have died,<br>
        Borne off to distance by the growing tide, <br>
        Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence, <br>
        With Pelias wounded, and without defense. <br>
        New clamors from th' invested palace ring:<br>
        We run to die, or disengage the king.<br>
        So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose, <br>
        While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose <br>
        As all the Dardan and Argolic race <br>
        Had been contracted in that narrow space; <br>
        Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,<br>
        And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. <br>
        Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, <br>
        Secure advancing, to the turrets rose: <br>
        Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,<br>
        Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;<br>
        Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent,<br>
        While with their right they seize the battlement.<br>
        From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw<br>
        Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; <br>
        And heavy beams and rafters from the sides <br>
        (Such arms their last necessity provides)<br>
        And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,<br>
        The marks of state and ancient royalty.<br>
        The guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend <br>
        The charge undaunted, and the gate defend. <br>
        Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath,<br>
        A second time we ran to tempt our death,<br>
        To clear the palace from the foe, succeed <br>
        The weary living, and revenge the dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        "A <span class="tooltip">postern<span class="tooltiptext">a back or side entrance.</span></span> door, yet unobserv'd and free, <br>
        Join'd by the length of a blind gallery,<br>
        To the king's closet led: a way well known<br>
        To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne,<br>
        Thro' which she brought Astyanax, unseen,<br>
        To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen.<br>
        Thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence<br>
        With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense. <br>
        From this the trembling king had oft descried <br>
        The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride. <br>
        Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,<br>
        Then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew; <br>
        And, where the rafters on the columns meet,<br>
        We push them headlong with our arms and feet. <br>
        The lightning flies not swifter than the fall, <br>
        Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall: <br>
        Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath <br>
        Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death. <br>
        Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent; <br>
        We cease not from above, nor they below relent. <br>
        Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud,<br>
        With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.<br>
        So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake,<br>
        Who slept the winter in a thorny <span class="tooltip">brake<span class="tooltiptext">a thicket.</span></span>,<br>
        And, casting off his slough when spring returns,<br>
        Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;<br>
        Restor'd with pois'nous herbs, his ardent sides <br>
        Reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides; <br>
        High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along,<br>
        And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.<br>
        Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,<br>
        His father's charioteer, together run <br>
        To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry<br>
        Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free. <br>
        Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;<br>
        And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. <br>
        Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,<br>
        And with his ax repeated strokes bestows <br>
        On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply, <br>
        Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. <br>
        He hews apace; the double bars at length <br>
        Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.<br>
        A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd <br>
        Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd; <br>
        The halls of audience, and of public state,<br>
        And where the lonely queen in secret sate.<br>
        Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, <br>
        With not a door, and scarce a space, between. <br>
        The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries, <br>
        And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies; <br>
        The fearful matrons run from place to place,<br>
        And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.<br>
        The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,<br>
        And all his father sparkles in his eyes;<br>
        Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain: <br>
        The bars are broken, and the guards are slain. <br>
        In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; <br>
        Those few defendants whom they find, they kill. <br>
        Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood <br>
        Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood; <br>
        Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,<br>
        And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.<br>
        These eyes beheld him when he march'd between<br>
        The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen,<br>
        The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,<br>
        To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood. <br>
        The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, <br>
        So large a promise, of a progeny),<br>
        The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,<br>
        Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils. <br>
        Where'er the raging fire had left a space, <br>
        The Grecians enter and possess the place.
