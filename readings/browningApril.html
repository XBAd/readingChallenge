      <h2>HOME-THOUGHTS, FROM ABROAD</h2>
      <p>
        O, to be in England<br>
        Now that April's there.<br>
        And whoever wakes in England<br>
        Sees, some morning, unaware,<br>
        That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf<br>
        Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,<br>
        While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough<br>
        In England — now!
      </p>

      <p>
        And after April, when May follows,<br>
        And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!<br>
        Hark, where my blossom'd pear-tree in the hedge<br>
        Leans to the field and scatters on the clover<br>
        Blossoms and dewdrops — at the bent spray's edge — <br>
        That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,<br>
        Lest you should think he never could recapture<br>
        The first fine careless rapture!<br>
        And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,<br>
        All will be gay when noontide wakes anew<br>
        The buttercups, the little children's dower<br>
        — Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!
      </p>

      <h2>HOME-THOUGHTS, FROM THE SEA</h2>
      <p>
        Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-west died away;<br>
        Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;<br>
        Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;<br>
        In the dimmest North-east distance dawn'd Gibraltar grand and <br>
        gray;<br>
        'Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?'<br>
        — say,<br>
        Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God to praise and pray,<br>
        While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.
      </p>

      <h2>PARTING AT MORNING</h2>
      <p>
        Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,<br>
        And the sun look'd over the mountain's rim:<br>
        And straight was a path of gold for him,<br>
        And the need of a world of men for me.
      </p>

      <h2>THE LOST MISTRESS</h2>
      <p>
        All's over, then: does truth sound bitter<br>
        As one at first believes?<br>
        Hark, 'tis the sparrows' good-night twitter<br>
        About your cottage eaves!
      </p>

      <p>
        And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,<br>
        I noticed that, to-day;<br>
        One day more bursts them open fully<br>
        — You know the red turns gray.
      </p>

      <p>
        To-morrow we meet the same then, dearest?<br>
        May I take your hand in mine?<br>
        Mere friends are we, — well, friends the merest<br>
        Keep much that I resign:
      </p>

      <p>
        For each glance of the eye so bright and black,<br>
        Though I keep with heart's endeavour, — <br>
        Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back,<br>
        Though it stay in my soul for ever! -
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet I will but say what mere friends say,<br>
        Or only a thought stronger;<br>
        I will hold your hand but as long as all may,<br>
        Or so very little longer!
      </p>

      <h2>THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER</h2>

      <p>
        I said — Then, dearest, since 'tis so,<br>
        Since now at length my fate I know,<br>
        Since nothing all my love avails,<br>
        Since all, my life seem'd meant for, fails,<br>
        Since this was written and needs must be — <br>
        My whole heart rises up to bless<br>
        Your name in pride and thankfulness!<br>
        Take back the hope you gave, — I claim<br>
        Only a memory of the same,<br>
        — And this beside, if you will not blame;<br>
        Your leave for one more last ride with me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mistress bent that brow of hers,<br>
        Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs<br>
        When pity would be softening through,<br>
        Fix'd me a breathing-while or two<br>
        With life or death in the balance: right!<br>
        The blood replenish'd me again;<br>
        My last thought was at least not vain:<br>
        I and my mistress, side by side<br>
        Shall be together, breathe and ride,<br>
        So, one day more am I deified.<br>
        Who knows but the world may end to-night?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hush! if you saw some western cloud<br>
        All billowy-bosom'd, over-bow'd<br>
        By many benedictions — sun's<br>
        And moon's and evening-star's at once — <br>
        And so, you, looking and loving best,<br>
        Conscious grew, your passion drew<br>
        Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,<br>
        Down on you, near and yet more near,<br>
        Till flesh must fade for heaven was here! — <br>
        Thus leant she and linger'd — joy and fear!<br>
        Thus lay she a moment on my breast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then we began to ride. My soul<br>
        Smooth'd itself out, a long-cramp'd scroll<br>
        Freshening and fluttering in the wind.<br>
        Past hopes already lay behind.<br>
        What need to strive with a life awry?<br>
        Had I said that, had I done this,<br>
        So might I gain, so might I miss.<br>
        Might she have loved me? just as well<br>
        She might have hated, who can tell!<br>
        Where had I been now if the worst befell?<br>
        And here we are riding, she and I.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fail I alone, in words and deeds?<br>
        Why, all men strive and who succeeds?<br>
        We rode; it seem'd my spirit flew,<br>
        Saw other regions, cities new,<br>
        As the world rush'd by on either side.<br>
        I thought, — All labour, yet no less<br>
        Bear up beneath their unsuccess.<br>
        Look at the end of work, contrast <br>
        The petty done, the undone vast,<br>
        This present of theirs with the hopeful past!<br>
        I hoped she would love me; here we ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        What hand and brain went ever pair'd?<br>
        What heart alike conceived and dared?<br>
        What act proved all its thought had been?<br>
        What will but felt the fleshly screen?
      </p>

      <p>
        We ride and I see her bosom heave.<br>
        There's many a crown for who can reach.<br>
        Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!<br>
        The flag stuck on a heap of bones,<br>
        A soldier's doing! what atones?<br>
        They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.<br>
        My riding is better, by their leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        What does it all mean, poet? Well,<br>
        Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell<br>
        What we felt only; you express'd<br>
        You hold things beautiful the best,<br>
        And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.<br>
        'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,<br>
        Have you yourself what's best for men?<br>
        Are you — poor, sick, old ere your time — <br>
        Nearer one whit your own sublime<br>
        Than we who never have turn'd a rhyme?<br>
        Sing, riding's a joy! For me, I ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        And you, great sculptor — so, you gave <br>
        A score of years to Art, her slave, <br>
        And that's your Venus, whence we turn <br>
        To yonder girl that fords the burn!<br>
        You acquiesce, and shall I repine?<br>
        What, man of music, you grown gray <br>
        With notes and nothing else to say, <br>
        Is this your sole praise from a friend, <br>
        'Greatly his opera's strains intend, <br>
        Put in music we know how fashions end!'<br>
        I gave my youth: but we ride, in fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who knows what's fit for us? Had fate <br>
        Proposed bliss here should sublimate <br>
        My being — had I sign'd the bond — <br>
        Still one must lead some life beyond, <br>
        Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried. <br>
        This foot once planted on the goal, <br>
        This glory-garland round my soul, <br>
        Could I descry such? Try and test!<br>
        I sink back shuddering from the quest<br>
        Earth being so good, would heaven seem best? <br>
        Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet — she has not spoke so long!<br>
        What if heaven be that, fair and strong<br>
        At life's best, with our eyes upturn'd<br>
        Whither life's flower is first discern'd,<br>
        We, fix'd so, ever should so abide?<br>
        What if we still ride on, we two<br>
        With life for ever old yet new,<br>
        Changed not in kind but in degree,<br>
        The instant made eternity, — <br>
        And heaven just prove that I and she <br>
        Ride, ride together, for ever ride?
      </p>

      <h2>PIPPA'S SONG</h2>
      <p>
        The year's at the spring,<br>
        And day's at the morn;<br>
        Morning's at seven; <br>
        The hill-side's dew-pearl'd;<br>
        The lark's on the wing;<br>
        The snail's on the thorn;<br>
        God's in His heaven — <br>
        All's right with the world!
      </p>

      <h2>YOU'LL LOVE ME YET</h2>
      <p>
        You'll love me yet! — and I can tarry<br>
        Your love's protracted growing:<br>
        June rear'd that bunch of flowers you carry, <br>
        From seeds of April's sowing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I plant a heartful now: some seed <br>
        At least is sure to strike, <br>
        And yield — what you'll not pluck indeed, <br>
        Not love, but, may be, like.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll look at least on love's remains, <br>
        A grave's one violet: <br>
        Your look? — that pays a thousand pains.<br>
        What's death? You'll love me yet!
