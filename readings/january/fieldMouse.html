          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse" target="_blank">To a Mouse</a>
           is a Scots-language poem written by Robert Burns in 1785,
           and was included in the Kilmarnock volume, a collection of his poetry.
           According to legend, Burns was ploughing in the fields and accidentally
           destroyed a mouse's nest, which it needed to survive the winter.
           In fact, Burns's brother claimed that the poet composed the poem while
           still holding his plough. Robert Burns is widely regarded as the national
           poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of
           the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his
           writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an
           audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in
           these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.
           He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his
           death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of
           both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and
           among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life
           and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th
           and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong
           on Scottish literature.
