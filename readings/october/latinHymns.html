      <h2>Latin Hymns</h2>

      <h3>Te Deum Laudamus</h3>
      <h3>Attributed to Niceta of Remisiana (4th Century)</h3>

      <p>
        WE praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. <br>
        All the earth doth worship thee, the Father everlasting.<br>
        To thee all Angels cry aloud: the Heavens, and all the Powers therein.<br>
        To thee Churubin and Seraphin continually do cry,<br>
        Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth;<br>
        Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty of thy Glory.<br>
        The glorious company of the Apostles praise thee.<br>
        The goodly fellowship of the Prophets praise thee.<br>
        The noble army of Martyrs praise thee.<br>
        The holy Church throughout all the world doth acknowledge thee;<br>
        The Father, of an infinite Majesty;<br>
        Thine honourable, true, and only Son;<br>
        Also the Holy Ghost, the Comforter.<br>
        Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ!<br>
        Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father.<br>
        When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, thou didst not abhor the Virgin’s womb.<br>
        When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.<br>
        Thou sittest at the right hand of God in the Glory of the Father.<br>
        We believe that thou shalt come to be our Judge.<br>
        We therefore pray thee, help thy servants whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.<br>
        Make them to be numbered with thy Saints in glory everlasting.<br>
        O Lord, save thy people and bless thine heritage.<br>
        Govern them, and lift them up for ever.<br>
        Day by day we magnify thee;<br>
        And we worship thy Name, ever world without end.<br>
        Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin.<br>
        O Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us.<br>
        O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us: as our trust is in thee.<br>
        O Lord, in thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded.

      <h3>Veni Creator Spiritus</h3>
      <h3>Attributed to Charlemagne. Tr. John Dryden (742–814)</h3>

      <p>
        CREATOR SPIRIT, by whose aid<br>
        The world’s foundations first were laid,<br>
        Come, visit every pious mind;<br>
        Come, pour thy joys on human kind;<br>
        From sin and sorrow set us free,<br>
        And make thy temples worthy thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        O source of uncreated light,<br>
      The Father’s promised Paraclete,<br>
      Thrice holy fount, thrice holy fire,<br>
      Our hearts with heavenly love inspire;<br>
      Come, and thy sacred unction bring<br>
      To sanctify us while we sing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plenteous of grace, descend from high,<br>
      Rich in thy sevenfold energy;<br>
      Thou strength of his almighty hand,<br>
      Whose power does heaven and earth command,<br>
      Proceeding Spirit, our defence,<br>
      Who dost the gift of tongues dispense,<br>
      And crown’st thy gift with eloquence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refine and purge our earthy parts,<br>
      But O, inflame and fire our hearts,<br>
      Our frailties help, our vice control;<br>
      Submit the senses to the soul,<br>
      And, when rebellious they are grown,<br>
      Then lay thy hand, and hold them down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chase from our minds the infernal foe,<br>
      And peace, the fruit of love, bestow;<br>
      And, lest our feet should step astray,<br>
      Protect and guide us in the way;
      </p>

      <p>
        Make us eternal truths receive<br>
      And practise all that we believe<br>
      Give us thyself, that we may see<br>
      The Father and the Son by thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immortal honour, endless fame,<br>
      Attend the Almighty Father’s name:<br>
      The Saviour Son be glorified,<br>
      Who for lost man’s redemption died;<br>
      And equal adoration be,<br>
      Eternal Paraclete, to thee.
      </p>

      <h3>Hic Breve Vivitur</h3>

      <h3>From “De Contemptu Mundi” By Bernard of Morlaix. Tr. J. M. Neale (cir. 1125)</h3>

      <p>
        BRIEF life is here our portion,<br>
          Brief sorrow, short-lived care;<br>
        The life that knows no ending,<br>
          The tearless life, is there.
      </p>

      <p>
        And after fleshly scandal,<br>
          And after this world’s night,<br>
        And after storm and whirlwind,<br>
          Is calm and joy and light.
      </p>

      <p>
        There grief is turned to pleasure,<br>
          Such pleasure as, below,<br>
        No human voice can utter,<br>
          No human heart can know:
      </p>

      <p>
        The peace of all the faithful,<br>
          The calm of all the blest,<br>
        Inviolate, unvaried,<br>
          Divinest, sweetest, best.
      </p>

      <p>
        That peace,—but who may claim it?<br>
          The guileless in their way,<br>
        Who keep the ranks of battle,<br>
          Who mean the thing they say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strive, man, to win that glory,<br>
          Toil, man, to gain that light,<br>
        Send hope before to grasp it,<br>
          Till hope be lost in sight!
      </p>

      <h3>Urbs Sion Aurea</h3>

      <h3>From “De Contemptu Mundi” By Bernard of Morlaix. Tr. J. M. Neale (cir. 1125)</h3>

      <p>
        JERUSALEM the golden,<br>
          With milk and honey blest,<br>
        Beneath thy contemplation<br>
          Sink heart and voice oppressed<br>
        I know not, O, I know not,<br>
          What social joys are there,<br>
        What radiancy of glory,<br>
          What light beyond compare!
      </p>

      <p>
        They stand, those halls of Zion,<br>
          Conjubilant with song,<br>
        And bright with many an angel<br>
          And all the martyr throng.<br>
        And they who, with their Leader,<br>
          Have conquered in the fight,<br>
        Forever and forever<br>
          Are clad in robes of white.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jerusalem the glorious,<br>
          The glory of the elect,<br>
        O dear and future vision<br>
          That eager hearts expect,<br>
        New mansion of new people,<br>
          Whom God’s own love and light<br>
        Promote, increase, make holy,<br>
          Identify, unite!
      </p>

      <h3>Jesu, Dulcis Memoria</h3>

      <h3>St. Bernard of Clairvaux Tr. E. Caswall (1091–1153)</h3>

      <p>
        JESU, the very thought of Thee<br>
          With sweetness fills the breast;<br>
        But sweeter far Thy Face to see,<br>
          And in Thy Presence rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        No voice can sing, no heart can frame,<br>
          Nor can the memory find<br>
        A sweeter sound than Jesu’s Name,<br>
          The Saviour of mankind.
      </p>

      <p>
        O Hope of every contrite heart,<br>
          O Joy of all the meek,<br>
        To those who ask how kind Thou art,<br>
          How good to those who seek!
      </p>

      <p>
        But what to those who find? Ah! this<br>
          Nor tongue nor pen can show;<br>
        The love of Jesus, what it is<br>
          None but His loved ones know.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesu, our only Joy be Thou,<br>
          As Thou our Prize wilt be:<br>
        In Thee be all our glory now,<br>
          And through eternity.
      </p>

      <h3>Jesu, Dulcedo Cordium</h3>

      <h3>St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Tr. Ray Palmer (1091–1153)</h3>

      <p>
        JESUS, Thou Joy of loving hearts!<br>
          Thou Fount of Life! Thou Light of men!<br>
        From the best bliss that earth imparts,<br>
          We turn unfill’d to Thee again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;<br>
          Thou savest those that on Thee call;<br>
        To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,<br>
          To them that find Thee, All in All!
      </p>

      <p>
        We taste Thee, O Thou Living Bread,<br>
          And long to feast upon Thee still!<br>
        We drink of Thee, the Fountain Head,<br>
          And thirst our souls from Thee to fill!
      </p>

      <p>
        Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,<br>
          Where’er our changeful lot is cast;<br>
        Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see,<br>
          Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        O Jesus, ever with us stay!<br>
          Make all our moments calm and bright!<br>
        Chase the dark night of sin away,<br>
          Shed o’er the world Thy holy light!
      </p>

      <h3>Dies Iræ, Dies Illa</h3>

      <h3>Thomas A. Celano. Tr. J. O’Hagan (d. 1275)</h3>

      <p>
        DAY of wrath, that day whose knelling<br>
        Gives to flame this earthly dwelling;<br>
        Psalm and Sibyl thus foretelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, what agony of trembling,<br>
        When the judge mankind assembling,<br>
        Probeth all beyond dissembling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pealing wondrous through the regions,<br>
        Shall the trumpet force obedience,<br>
        And the graves yield up their legions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Startled death and nature sicken,<br>
        Thus to see the creature quicken,<br>
        Waiting judgment terror-stricken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open, then, with all recorded,<br>
        Stands the book from whence awarded<br>
        Doom shall pass with deed accorded.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the judge is throned in session,<br>
        All things hid shall find confession,<br>
        Unavenged be no transgression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wretch, what then shall be my pleading?<br>
        Who my patron interceding?<br>
        Scarce the just securely speeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou, O king of awful splendour,<br>
        Saving grace dost freely render;<br>
        Save me, fount of pity tender.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think, ’twas I, my lost condition,<br>
        Caused, O pitying Lord, thy mission;<br>
        Spare my soul that day’s perdition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeking me, thy footstep hasted;<br>
        Me to save, the cross was tasted,<br>
        Be not toil so mighty wasted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Righteous judge of retribution,<br>
        Grant the gift of absolution<br>
        Ere the day of restitution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Me my culprit heart accuses;<br>
        Inmost guilt my face suffuses;<br>
        Heal, O Lord, thy suppliant’s bruises.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou who Mary’s sin hast shriven,<br>
        Thou who broughtst the thief to heaven,<br>
        Hope to me hast also given.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing worth is mine endeavour,<br>
        Yet, in ruth, my soul deliver<br>
        From the flame that burns for ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        With thy sheep, thy chosen, place me,<br>
        Severed from the goats embrace me;<br>
        On thy right-hand, ransomed, place me.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the reprobate confounded<br>
        Lie with wrathful fire surrounded,<br>
        May my call to bliss be sounded.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crushed to dust and prostrate bending,<br>
        All my heart contrition rending;<br>
        I implore thee, guard my ending.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, that awful day of mourning,<br>
        When, from earthly dust returning,
      </p>

      <p>
        Guilty man shall bide his sentence;<br>
        Spare him, God, for his repentance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesus, Lord, thy mercy lending,<br>
        Grant them rest, thy rest unending.
      </p>

      <h3>Stabat Mater</h3>

      <h3>Jacobus de Benedictis. Tr. D. F. Maccarthy (13th–14th Century)</h3>

      <p>
        BY the cross, on which suspended,<br>
        With his bleeding hands extended,<br>
          Hung that Son she so adored,<br>
        Stood the mournful Mother weeping,<br>
        She whose heart, its silence keeping,<br>
          Grief had cleft as with a sword.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, that Mother’s sad affliction—<br>
        Mother of all benediction—<br>
          Of the sole-begotten One;<br>
        Oh, the grieving, sense-bereaving,<br>
        Of her heaving breast, perceiving<br>
          The dread sufferings of her Son.
      </p>

      <p>
        What man is there so unfeeling,<br>
        Who, his heart to pity steeling,<br>
          Could behold that sight unmoved?<br>
        Could Christ’s Mother see there weeping,<br>
        See the pious Mother keeping<br>
          Vigil by the Son she loved?
      </p>

      <p>
        For his people’s sins atoning,<br>
        She saw Jesus writhing, groaning,<br>
          ’Neath the scourge wherewith he bled;<br>
        Saw her loved one, her consoler,<br>
        Dying in his dreadful dolour,<br>
          Till at length his spirit fled.
      </p>

      <p>
        O thou Mother of election,<br>
        Fountain of all pure affection,<br>
          Make thy grief, thy pain, my own;<br>
        Make my heart to God returning,<br>
        In the love of Jesus burning,<br>
          Feel the fire that thine has known.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blessed Mother of prediction,<br>
        Stamp the marks of crucifixion<br>
          Deeply on my stony heart,<br>
        Ever leading where thy bleeding<br>
        Son is pleading for my needing,<br>
          Let me in his wounds take part.
      </p>

      <p>
        Make me truly, each day newly<br>
        While life lasts, O Mother, duly<br>
          Weep with him, the Crucified.<br>
        Let me, ’tis my sole demanding,<br>
        Near the cross, where thou art standing,<br>
          Stand in sorrow at thy side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Queen of virgins, best and dearest,<br>
        Grant, oh, grant the prayer thou hearest,<br>
          Let me ever mourn with thee;<br>
        Let compassion me so fashion<br>
        That Christ’s wounds, his death and passion,<br>
          Be each day renewed in me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, those wounds do not deny me;<br>
        On that cross, oh, crucify me;<br>
          Let me drink his blood I pray:<br>
        Then on fire, enkindled, daring,<br>
        I may stand without despairing<br>
          On that dreadful judgment-day.
      </p>

      <p>
        May that cross be my salvation;<br>
        Make Christ’s death my preservation;<br>
          May his grace my heart make wise;<br>
        And when death my body taketh,<br>
        May my soul when it awaketh<br>
          Ope in heaven its raptured eyes.
      </p>

      <h3>O Deus, Ego Amo Te</h3>

      <h3>Attributed To St. Francis Xavier. Tr. Edward Caswall (1506–1552)</h3>

      <p>
        MY God, I love thee: not because<br>
          I hope for heaven thereby,<br>
        Nor because they who love thee not<br>
          Must burn eternally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou, O my Jesus, Thou didst me<br>
          Upon the Cross embrace;<br>
        For me didst bear the nails and spear,<br>
          And manifold disgrace.
      </p>

      <p>
        And grief and torments numberless,<br>
          And sweat of agony;<br>
        Yea, death itself; and all for me<br>
          Who was thine enemy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then why, O Blessèd Jesu Christ,<br>
          Should I not love thee well?—<br>
        Not for the hope of winning heaven,<br>
          Nor of escaping hell;
      </p>

      <p>
        Not with the hope of gaining aught,<br>
          Not seeking a reward;<br>
        But as thyself hast lovèd me,<br>
          O ever-loving Lord!
      </p>

      <p>
        E’en so I love thee and will love,<br>
          And in thy praise will sing,<br>
        Solely because thou art my God,<br>
          And my eternal King.

      <h3>The Pillar of Cloud</h3>

      <h3>John Henry Newman (1801–1890)</h3>

      <p>
        LEAD, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,<br>
            Lead thou me on!<br>
        The night is dark, and I am far from home,—<br>
            Lead thou me on!<br>
        Keep thou my feet! I do not ask to see<br>
        The distant scene—one step enough for me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou<br>
            Shouldst lead me on;<br>
        I loved to choose and see my path; but now<br>
            Lead thou me on!<br>
        I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,<br>
        Pride ruled my will: remember not past years!
      </p>

      <p>
        So long thy power hath blest me, sure it still<br>
            Will lead me on,<br>
        O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till<br>
            The night is gone,<br>
        And with the morn those angel faces smile<br>
        Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
      </p>

      <h3>Nearer, My God, to Thee</h3>

      <h3>Sarah Flower Adams (1805–1848)</h3>

      <p>
        NEARER, my God, to thee,<br>
          Nearer to thee!<br>
        E’en though it be a cross<br>
          That raiseth me,<br>
        Still all my song would be,<br>
        Nearer, my God, to thee,<br>
          Nearer to thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        Though like the wanderer,<br>
          The sun gone down,<br>
        Darkness be over me,<br>
          My rest a stone,<br>
        Yet in my dreams I’d be<br>
        Nearer, my God, to thee,<br>
          Nearer to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        There let the way appear<br>
          Steps unto heaven;<br>
        All that thou send’st to me<br>
          In mercy given;<br>
        Angels to beckon me<br>
        Nearer, my God, to thee,<br>
          Nearer to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, with my waking thoughts<br>
          Bright with thy praise,<br>
        Out of my stony griefs<br>
          Bethel I’ll raise;<br>
        So by my woes to be<br>
        Nearer, my God, to thee,<br>
          Nearer to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Or if on joyful wing<br>
          Cleaving the sky,<br>
        Sun, moon, and stars forgot,<br>
          Upwards I fly,<br>
        Still all my song shall be,<br>
        Nearer, my God, to thee,<br>
          Nearer to thee!
