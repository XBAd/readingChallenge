          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" target="_blank">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>
           (4 August 1792 – 8 July 1822) was one of the major English Romantic
           poets, who is regarded by some as among the finest lyric and
           philosophical poets in the English language, and one of the most influential.
           A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views,
           Shelley did not see fame during his lifetime, but recognition of his
           achievements in poetry grew steadily following his death.
           Shelley was a key member of a close circle of visionary poets and
           writers that included Lord Byron, John Keats, Leigh Hunt, Thomas
           Love Peacock and his own second wife, Mary Shelley, the author of <em>Frankenstein</em>.

      <h2>To a Skylark</h2>

      <p>
        HAIL to thee, blithe Spirit! <br>
          Bird thou never wert,<br>
        That from heaven, or near it,<br>
          Pourest thy full heart<br>
    In profuse strains of unpremeditated art
      </p>

      <p>
        Higher still and higher<br>
          From the earth thou springest<br>
        Like a cloud of fire;<br>
          The blue deep thou wingest,<br>
    And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the golden lightning<br>
          Of the sunken sun<br>
        O’er which clouds are brightening,<br>
          Thou dost float and run,<br>
    Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pale purple even<br>
          Melts around thy flight;<br>
        Like a star of heaven<br>
          In the broad daylight<br>
    Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight:
      </p>

      <p>
        Keen as are the arrows<br>
          Of that silver sphere,<br>
        Whose intense lamp narrows<br>
          In the white dawn clear<br>
    Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the earth and air<br>
          With thy voice is loud,<br>
        As, when night is bare,<br>
          From one lonely cloud<br>
    The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        What thou art we know not;<br>
          What is most like thee?<br>
        From rainbow clouds there flow not<br>
          Drops so bright to see<br>
    As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like a poet hidden<br>
          In the light of thought,<br>
        Singing hymns unbidden,<br>
          Till the world is wrought<br>
    To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
      </p>

      <p>
        Like a high-born maiden<br>
          In a palace tower,<br>
        Soothing her love-laden<br>
          Soul in secret hour<br>
    With music sweet as love, which overflows her <span class="tooltip">bower<span class="tooltiptext">a lady's private apartment in a medieval hall or castle</span></span>:
      </p>

      <p>
        Like a glow-worm golden<br>
          In a dell of dew,<br>
        Scattering unbeholden<br>
          Its aerial hue<br>
    Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
      </p>

      <p>
        Like a rose embower’d<br>
          In its own green leaves,<br>
        By warm winds deflower’d,<br>
          Till the scent it gives<br>
    Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sound of vernal showers<br>
          On the twinkling grass,<br>
        Rain-awaken’d flowers,<br>
          All that ever was<br>
    Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teach us, sprite or bird,<br>
          What sweet thoughts are thine:<br>
        I have never heard<br>
          Praise of love or wine<br>
    That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chorus hymeneal<br>
          Or triumphal chaunt<br>
        Match’d with thine, would be all<br>
          But an empty <span class="tooltip">vaunt<span class="tooltiptext">a boast.</span></span>—<br>
    A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
      </p>

      <p>
        What objects are the fountains<br>
          Of thy happy strain?<br>
        What fields, or waves, or mountains?<br>
          What shapes of sky or plain?<br>
    What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
      </p>

      <p>
        With thy clear keen joyance<br>
          Languor cannot be:<br>
        Shadow of annoyance<br>
          Never came near thee:<br>
    Thou lovest; but ne’er knew love’s sad satiety.
      </p>

      <p>
        Waking or asleep<br>
          Thou of death must deem<br>
        Things more true and deep<br>
          Than we mortals dream,<br>
    Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
      </p>

      <p>
        We look before and after,<br>
          And pine for what is not:<br>
        Our sincerest laughter<br>
          With some pain is fraught;<br>
    Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet if we could scorn<br>
          Hate, and pride, and fear;<br>
        If we were things born<br>
          Not to shed a tear,<br>
    I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
      </p>

      <p>
        Better than all measures<br>
          Of delightful sound,<br>
        Better than all treasures<br>
          That in books are found,<br>
    Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
      </p>

      <p>
        Teach me half the gladness<br>
          That thy brain must know,<br>
        Such harmonious madness<br>
          From my lips would flow<br>
    The world should listen then, as I am listening now!
      </p>

      <h2>Love’s Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        THE FOUNTAINS mingle with the river<br>
        And the rivers with the ocean,<br>
        The winds of heaven mix for ever<br>
        With a sweet emotion;<br>
        Nothing in the world is single,<br>
        All things by a law divine<br>
        In one another’s being mingle—<br>
        Why not I with thine?
      </p>

      <p>
        See the mountains kiss high heaven<br>
        And the waves clasp one another;<br>
        No sister-flower would be forgiven<br>
        If it disdain’d its brother:<br>
        And the sunlight clasps the earth,<br>
        And the moonbeams kiss the sea—<br>
        What are all these kissings worth,<br>
        If thou kiss not me?
      </p>

      <h2>To the Night</h2>

      <p>
        SWIFTLY walk over the western wave,<br>
                  Spirit of Night!<br>
        Out of the misty eastern cave<br>
        Where, all the long and lone daylight,<br>
        Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear<br>
        Which make thee terrible and dear,—<br>
                  Swift be thy flight!
      </p>

      <p>
        Wrap thy form in a mantle gray<br>
                  Star-inwrought!<br>
        Blind with thine hair the eyes of day,<br>
        Kiss her until she be wearied out:<br>
        Then wander o’er city and sea and land,<br>
        Touching all with thine opiate wand—<br>
                  Come, long-sought!
      </p>

      <p>
        When I arose and saw the dawn,<br>
                  I sigh’d for thee;<br>
        When light rode high, and the dew was gone,<br>
        And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,<br>
        And the weary Day turn’d to his rest<br>
        Lingering like an unloved guest,<br>
                  I sigh’d for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thy brother Death came, and cried<br>
                  Wouldst thou me?<br>
        Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,<br>
        Murmur’d like a noon-tide bee<br>
        Shall I nestle near thy side?<br>
        Wouldst thou me?—And I replied<br>
                  No, not thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        Death will come when thou art dead,<br>
                  Soon, too soon—<br>
        Sleep will come when thou art fled;<br>
        Of neither would I ask the boon<br>
        I ask of thee, belove´d Night—<br>
        Swift be thine approaching flight,<br>
                  Come soon, soon!
      </p>

      <h2>Ode to the West Wind</h2>

      <p>
        O WILD West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,<br>
        Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead<br>
        Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,<br>
        Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,<br>
        Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou<br>
        Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed<br>
        The winge´d seeds, where they lie cold and low,<br>
        Each like a corpse within its grave, until<br>
        Thine azure sister of the spring shall blow<br>
        Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill<br>
        (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)<br>
        With living hues and odours plain and hill:<br>
        Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;<br>
        Destroyer and Preserver; Hear, O hear!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou on whose stream, ’mid the steep sky’s commotion,<br>
      Loose clouds like earth’s decaying leaves are shed,<br>
      Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,<br>
      Angels of rain and lightning; there are spread<br>
      On the blue surface of thine airy surge,<br>
      Like the bright hair uplifted from the head<br>
      Of some fierce <span class="tooltip">Maenad<span class="tooltiptext">(in ancient Greece) a female follower of Bacchus, traditionally associated with divine possession and frenzied rites.</span></span>, ev’n from the dim verge<br>
      Of the horizon to the zenith’s height—<br>
      The locks of the approaching storm. Thou <span class="tooltip">dirge<span class="tooltiptext">a song or hymn of grief or lamentation</span></span><br>
      Of the dying year, to which this closing night<br>
      Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,<br>
      Vaulted with all thy congregated might,<br>
      Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere<br>
      Black rain, and fire, and hail, will burst: O hear!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou who didst waken from his summer-dreams<br>
      The blue Mediterranean, where he lay<br>
      Lull’d by the coil of his crystalline streams,<br>
      Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,<br>
      And saw in sleep old palaces and towers<br>
      Quivering within the wave’s intenser day,<br>
      All overgrown with azure moss and flowers<br>
      So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou<br>
      For whose path the Atlantic’s level powers<br>
      Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below<br>
      The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear<br>
      The sapless foliage of the ocean, know<br>
      Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear<br>
      And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!
      </p>

      <p>
        If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;<br>
      If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;<br>
      A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share<br>
      The impulse of thy strength, only less free<br>
      Than Thou, O uncontrollable! If even<br>
      I were as in my boyhood, and could be<br>
      The comrade of thy wanderings over heaven,<br>
      As then, when to outstrip thy skyey speed<br>
      Scarce seem’d a vision, I would ne’er have striven<br>
      As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.<br>
      O lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!<br>
      I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!<br>
      A heavy weight of hours has chain’d and bow’d<br>
      One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
      </p>

      <p>
        Make me thy lyre, ev’n as the forest is:<br>
      What if my leaves are falling like its own!<br>
      The tumult of thy mighty harmonies<br>
      Will take from both a deep autumnal tone,<br>
      Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,<br>
      My spirit! be thou me, impetuous one!<br>
      Drive my dead thoughts over the universe<br>
      Like wither’d leaves, to quicken a new birth;<br>
      And, by the incantation of this verse,<br>
      Scatter, as from an unextinguish’d hearth<br>
      Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!<br>
      Be through my lips to unawaken’d earth<br>
      The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,<br>
      If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?
