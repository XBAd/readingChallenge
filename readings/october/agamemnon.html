      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Woe for my city, woe for Ilion’s fall! <br>
          Father, how oft with sanguine stain<br>
        Streamed on thine altar-stone the blood of cattle, slain<br>
          That heaven might guard our wall!<br>
          But all was shed in vain.<br>
        Low lie the shattered towers whereas they fell,<br>
        And I—ah burning heart!—shall soon lie low as well.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Of sorrow is thy song, of sorrow still!<br>
          Alas, what power of ill<br>
        Sits heavy on thy heart and bids thee tell<br>
        In tears of perfect moan thy deadly tale?<br>
    Some woe—I know not what—must close thy piteous wail.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        List! for no more the presage of my soul,<br>
        Bride-like, shall peer from its secluding veil;<br>
        But as the morning wind blows clear the east,<br>
        More bright shall blow the wind of prophecy,<br>
        And as against the low bright line of dawn<br>
        Heaves high and higher yet the rolling wave,<br>
        So in the clearing skies of prescience<br>
        Dawns on my soul a further, deadlier woe,<br>
        And I will speak, but in dark speech no more.<br>
        Bear witness, ye, and follow at my side—<br>
        I scent the trail of blood, shed long ago.<br>
        Within this house a choir abidingly<br>
        Chants in harsh unison the chant of ill;<br>
        Yea, and they drink, for more enhardened joy,<br>
        Man’s blood for wine, and revel in the halls,<br>
        Departing never, Furies of the home.<br>
        They sit within, they chant the primal curse,<br>
        Each spitting hatred on that crime of old,<br>
        The brother’s couch, the love incestuous<br>
        That brought forth hatred to the ravisher.<br>
        Say, is my speech or wild and erring now,<br>
        Or doth its arrow cleave the mark indeed?<br>
        They called me once, The prophetess of lies,<br>
        The wandering hag, the pest of every door—<br>
        Attest ye now, She knows in very sooth<br>
        The house’s curse, the storied infamy.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Yet how should oath—how loyally soe’er<br>
        I swear it—aught avail thee? In good sooth,<br>
        My wonder meets thy claim: I stand amazed<br>
        That thou, a maiden born beyond the seas,<br>
        Dost as a native know and tell aright<br>
        Tales of a city of an alien tongue.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        That is my power—a boon Apollo gave.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        God though he were, yearning for mortal maid?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Ay! what seemed shame of old is shame no more.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Such finer sense suits not with slavery.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        He strove to win me, panting for my love.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Came ye by compact unto bridal joys?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Nay—for I plighted troth, then foiled the god.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Wert thou already dowered with prescience?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Yea—prophetess to Troy of all her doom.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        How left thee then Apollo’s wrath unscathed?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        I, false to him, seemed prophet false to all.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Not so—to us at least thy words seem sooth.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Woe for me, woe! Again the agony—<br>
        Dread pain that sees the future all too well<br>
        With ghastly preludes whirls and racks my soul.<br>
        Behold ye—yonder on the palace roof<br>
        The spectre-children sitting—look, such things<br>
        As dreams are made on, phantoms as of babes,<br>
        Horrible shadows, that a kinsman’s hand<br>
        Hath marked with murder, and their arms as full—<br>
        A rueful burden—see, they hold them up,<br>
        The entrails upon which their father fed!
      </p>

      <p>
        For this, for this, I say there plots revenge<br>
        A coward lion, couching in the lair—<br>
        Guarding the gate against my master’s foot—<br>
        My master-mine—I bear the slave’s yoke now,<br>
        And he, the lord of ships, who trod down Troy,<br>
        Knows not the fawning treachery of tongue<br>
        Of this thing false and dog-like—how her speech<br>
        Glazes and sleeks her purpose, till she win<br>
        By ill fate’s favour the desired chance,<br>
        Moving like Ate to a secret end.<br>
        O aweless soul! the woman slays her lord—<br>
        Woman? what loathsome monster of the earth<br>
        Were fit comparison? The double snake—<br>
        Or Scylla, where she dwells, the seaman’s bane,<br>
        Girt round about with rocks? some hag of hell,<br>
        Raving a truceless curse upon her kin?<br>
        Hark—even now she cries exultingly<br>
        The vengeful cry that tells of battle turned—<br>
        How fain, forsooth, to greet her chief restored!<br>
        Nay, then, believe me not: what skills belief<br>
        Or disbelief? Fate works its will—and thou<br>
        Wilt see and say in ruth, Her tale was true.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Ah—’tis Thyestes’ feast on kindred flesh—<br>
        I guess her meaning and with horror thrill,<br>
        Hearing no shadow’d hint of th’ o’er—true tale,<br>
        But its full hatefulness: yet, for the rest,<br>
        Far from the track I roam, and know no more.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis Agamemnon’s doom thou shalt behold.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Peace, hapless woman, to thy boding words!
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Far from my speech stands he who sains and saves.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Ay—were such doom at hand—which God forbid!
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Thou prayest idly—these move swift to slay.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        What man prepares a deed of such despite?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Fool! thus to read amiss mine oracles.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Deviser and device are dark to me.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Dark! all too well I speak the Grecian tongue.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Ay—but in thine, as in Apollo’s strains,<br>
        Familiar is the tongue, but dark the thought.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Ah ah the fire! it waxes, nears me now—<br>
        Woe, woe for me, Apollo of the dawn!
      </p>

      <p>
        Lo, how the woman-thing, the lioness<br>
        Couched with the wolf—her noble mate afar—<br>
        Will slay me, slave forlorn! Yea, like some witch,<br>
        She drugs the cup of wrath, that slays her lord<br>
        With double death—his recompense for me!<br>
        Ay, ’tis for me, the prey he bore from Troy,<br>
        That she hath sworn his death, and edged the steel!<br>
        Ye wands, ye wreaths that cling around my neck,<br>
        Ye showed me prophetess yet scorned of all—<br>
        I stamp you into death, or e’er I die—<br>
        Down, to destruction!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus I stand revenged—<br>
Go, crown some other with a prophet’s woe.<br>
Look! it is he, it is Apollo’s self<br>
Rending from me the prophet-robe he gave.<br>
God! while I wore it yet, thou saw’st me mocked<br>
There at my home by each malicious mouth—<br>
To all and each, an undivided scorn.<br>
The name alike and fate of witch and cheat—<br>
Woe, poverty, and famine—all I bore;<br>
And at this last the god hath brought me here<br>
Into death’s toils, and what his love had made,<br>
His hate unmakes me now: and I shall stand<br>
Not now before the altar of my home,<br>
But me a slaughter-house and block of blood<br>
Shall see hewn down, a reeking sacrifice.<br>
Yet shall the gods have heed of me who die,<br>
For by their will shall one requite my doom.<br>
He, to avenge his father’s blood outpoured,<br>
Shall smite and slay with matricidal hand.<br>
Ay, he shall come—tho’ far away he roam,<br>
A banished wanderer in a stranger’s land—<br>
To crown his kindred’s edifice of ille<br>
Called home to vengeance by his father’s fall:<br>
Thus have the high gods sworn, and shall fulfil.<br>
And now why mourn I, tarrying on earth,<br>
Since first mine Ilion has found its fate<br>
And I beheld, and those who won the wall<br>
Pass to such issue as the gods ordain?<br>
I too will pass and like them dare to die!  [Turns and looks upon the palace door.]<br>
Portal of Hades, thus I bid thee hail!<br>
Grant me one boon—a swift and mortal stroke,<br>
That all unwrong by pain, with ebbing blood<br>
Shed forth in quiet death, I close mine eyes.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Maid of mysterious woes, mysterious lore,<br>
        Long was thy prophecy: but if aright<br>
        Thou readest all thy fate, how, thus unscared,<br>
        Dost thou approach the altar of thy doom,<br>
        As fronts the knife some victim, heaven-controlled?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Friends, there is no avoidance in delay.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Yet who delays the longest, his the gain.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        The day is come—flight were small gain to me!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        O brave endurance of a soul resolved!
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        That were ill praise, for those of happier doom.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        All fame is happy, even famous death.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Ah sire, ah brethren, famous once were ye!  [She moves to enter the house, then starts back.]
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        What fear is this that scares thee from the house?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Pah!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        What is this cry? some dark despair of soul?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Pah! the house fumes with stench and spilth of blood.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        How? ’tis the smell of household offerings.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis rank as charnel-scent from open graves.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Thou canst not mean this scented Syrian nard?
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Nay, let me pass within to cry aloud<br>
        The monarch’s fate and mine—enough of life.<br>
        Ah friends!<br>
        Bear to me witness, since I fall in death,<br>
        That not as birds that shun the bush and scream<br>
        I moan in idle terror. This attest<br>
        When for my death’s revenge another dies,<br>
        A woman for a woman, and a man<br>
        Falls, for a man ill-wedded to his curse.<br>
        Grant me this boon—the last before I die.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Brave to the last! I mourn thy doom foreseen.
      </p>

      <h3>CASSANDRA</h3>

      <p>
        Once more one utterance, but not of wail,<br>
        Though for my death—and then I speak no more.<br>
        Sun! thou whose beam I shall not see again,<br>
        To thee I cry, Let those whom vengeance calls<br>
        To slay their kindred’s slayers, quit withal<br>
        The death of me, the slave, the fenceless prey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah state of mortal man! in time of weal,<br>
        A line, a shadow! and if ill fate fall,<br>
        One wet sponge-sweep wipes all our trace away—<br>
        And this I deem less piteous, of the twain.  [Exit into the palace.]
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Too true it is! our mortal state<br>
        With bliss is never satiate,<br>
        And none, before the palace high<br>
        And stately of prosperity,<br>
        Cries to us with a voice of fear,<br>
        Away! ’tis ill to enter here!
      </p>

      <p>
        Lo! this our lord hath trodden down,<br>
        By grace of heaven, old Priam’s town,<br>
            And praised as god he stands once more<br>
            On Argos’ shore!<br>
        Yet now—if blood shed long ago<br>
        Cries out that other blood shall flow—<br>
        His life-blood, his, to pay again<br>
        The stern requital of the slain—<br>
        Peace to that braggart’s vaunting vain,<br>
            Who, having heard the chieftain’s tale,<br>
            Yet boasts of bliss untouched by bale!  [A loud cry from within.]
      </p>

      <h3>VOICE OF AGAMEMNON</h3>

      <p>
        O I am sped—a deep, a mortal blow.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Listen, listen! who is screaming as in mortal agony?
      </p>

      <h3>VOICE OF AGAMEMNON</h3>

      <p>
        O! O! again, another, another blow!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        The bloody act is over—I have heard the monarch’s cry—<br>
        Let us swiftly take some counsel, lest we too be doomed to die.
      </p>

      <h3>ONE OF THE CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis best, I judge, aloud for aid to call,<br>
        “Ho! loyal Argives! to the palace, all!”
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Better, I deem, ourselves to bear the aid,<br>
        And drag the deed to light, while drips the blade.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Such will is mine, and what thou say’st I say:<br>
        Swiftly to act! the time brooks no delay.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Ay, for ’tis plain, this prelude of their song<br>
        Foretells its close in tyranny and wrong.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Behold, we tarry—but thy name, Delay,<br>
        They spurn, and press with sleepless hand to slay.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        I know not what ’twere well to counsel now—<br>
        Who wills to act, ’tis his to counsel how.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Thy doubt is mine: for when a man is slain,<br>
        I have no words to bring his life again.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        What? e’en for life’s sake, bow us to obey<br>
        These house-defilers and their tyrant sway?
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Unmanly doom! ’twere better far to die—<br>
        Death is a gentler lord than tyranny.
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Think well—must cry or sign of woe or pain<br>
        Fix our conclusion that the chief is slain?
      </p>

      <h3>ANOTHER</h3>

      <p>
        Such talk befits us when the deed we see—<br>
        Conjecture dwells afar from certainty.
      </p>

      <h3>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        I read one will from many a diverse word,<br>
        To know aright, how stands it with our lord!  [The scene opens, disclosing Clytemnestra, who comes forward. The body of Agamemnon lies, muffled in a long robe, within a silver-sided laver; the corpse of Cassandra is laid beside him.]
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Ho, ye who heard me speak so long and oft<br>
        The glozing word that led me to my will—<br>
        Hear how I shrink not to unsay it all!<br>
        How else should one who willeth to requite<br>
        Evil for evil to an enemy<br>
        Disguised as friend, weave the mesh straitly round him,<br>
        Not to be overleaped, a net of doom?<br>
        This is the sum and issue of old strife,<br>
        Of me deep-pondered and at length fulfilled.<br>
        All is avowed, and as I smote I stand<br>
        With foot set firm upon a finished thing!<br>
        I turn not to denial: thus I wrought<br>
        So that he could nor flee nor ward his doom.<br>
        Even as the trammel hems the scaly shoal,<br>
        I trapped him with inextricable toils,<br>
        The ill abundance of a baffling robe;<br>
        Then smote him, once, again—and at each wound<br>
        He cried aloud, then as in death relaxed<br>
        Each limb and sank to earth; and as he lay,<br>
        Once more I smote him, with the last third blow,<br>
        Sacred to Hades, saviour of the dead.<br>
        And thus he fell, and as he passed away,<br>
        Spirit with body chafed; each dying breath<br>
        Flung from his breast swift bubbling jets of gore,<br>
        And the dark sprinklings of the rain of blood<br>
        Fell upon me; and I was fain to feel<br>
        That dew—not sweeter is the rain of heaven<br>
        To cornland, when the green sheath teems with grain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elders of Argos—since the thing stands so,<br>
        I bid you to rejoice, if such your will:<br>
        Rejoice or not, I vaunt and praise the deed,<br>
        And well I ween, if seemly it could be,<br>
        ’Twere not ill done to pour libations here,<br>
        Justly—ay, more than justly—on his corpse<br>
        Who filled his home with curses as with wine,<br>
        And thus returned to drain the cup he filled.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        I marvel at thy tongue’s audacity,<br>
        To vaunt thus loudly o’er a husband slain.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Ye hold me as a woman, weak of will,<br>
        And strive to sway me: but my heart is stout,<br>
        Nor fears to speak its uttermost to you,<br>
        Albeit ye know its message. Praise or blame,<br>
        Even as ye list,—I reck not of your words.<br>
        Lo! at my feet lies Agamemnon slain,<br>
        My husband once—and him this hand of mine,<br>
        A right contriver, fashioned for his death.<br>
        Behold the deed!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Woman, what deadly birth,<br>
      What venomed essence of the earth<br>
      Or dark distilment of the wave,<br>
        To thee such passion gave,<br>
      Nerving thine hand<br>
      To set upon thy brow this burning crown,<br>
        The curses of thy land?<br>
      Our king by thee cut off, hewn down!<br>
        Go forth—they cry—accursèd and forlorn,<br>
          To hate and scorn!
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        O ye just men, who speak my sentence now,<br>
        The city’s hate, the ban of all my realm!<br>
        Ye had no voice of old to launch such doom<br>
        On him, my husband, when he held as light<br>
        My daughter’s life as that of sheep or goat,<br>
        One victim from the thronging fleecy fold!<br>
        Yea, slew in sacrifice his child and mine,<br>
        The well-loved issue of my travail-pangs,<br>
        To lull and lay the gales that blew from Thrace.<br>
        That deed of his, I say, that stain and shame,<br>
        Had rightly been atoned by banishment;<br>
        But ye, who then were dumb, are stern to judge<br>
        This deed of mine that doth affront your ears.<br>
        Storm out your threats, yet knowing this for sooth,<br>
        That I am ready, if your hand prevail<br>
        As mine now doth, to bow beneath your sway:<br>
        If God say nay, it shall be yours to learn<br>
        By chastisement a late humility.
