        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats" target="_blank">John Keats</a>
           (31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821) was an English Romantic poet.
           He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets,
           along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, despite his works having
           been in publication for only four years before his death from
           tuberculosis at the age of 25. Although his poems were not generally
           well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after
           his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the
           most beloved of all English poets. He had a significant influence on
           a diverse range of poets and writers. Jorge Luis Borges stated that
           his first encounter with Keats' work was the most significant literary
           experience of his life. The poetry of Keats is characterised by
           sensual imagery, most notably in the series of odes. This is typical
           of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through
           an emphasis on natural imagery. Today his poems and letters are some of
           the most popular and most analysed in English literature. Some of the
           most acclaimed works of Keats are "Ode to a Nightingale", "Sleep and Poetry",
           and the famous sonnet "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer".

      <h2>The Mermaid Tavern</h2>

      <p>
        SOULS of Poets dead and gone, <br>
        What <span class="tooltip">Elysium<span class="tooltiptext">the abode of the blessed after death in classical mythology; paradise</span></span> have ye known,<br>
        Happy field or mossy cavern,<br>
        Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?<br>
        Have ye tippled drink more fine<br>
        Than mine host’s Canary wine?
      </p>

      <p>
        Or are fruits of Paradise<br>
        Sweeter than those dainty pies<br>
        Of Venison? O generous food!<br>
        Drest as though bold Robin Hood<br>
        Would, with his Maid Marian,<br>
        Sup and bowse from horn and can.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have heard that on a day<br>
        Mine host’s sign-board flew away<br>
        Nobody knew whither, till<br>
        An astrologer’s old quill<br>
        To a sheepskin gave the story—<br>
        Said he saw you in your glory<br>
        Underneath a new-old Sign<br>
        Sipping beverage divine,<br>
        And pledging with contented smack<br>
        The Mermaid in the Zodiac!
      </p>

      <p>
        Souls of Poets dead and gone,<br>
        What Elysium have ye known—<br>
        Happy field or mossy cavern—<br>
        Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?
      </p>

      <h2>Happy Insensibility</h2>

      <p>
        IN a drear-nighted December,<br>
        Too happy, happy Tree,<br>
        Thy branches ne’er remember<br>
        The north cannot undo them<br>
        With a sleety whistle through them,<br>
        Nor frozen thawings glue them<br>
        From budding at the prime.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a drear-nighted December,<br>
        Too happy, happy Brook,<br>
        Thy bubblings ne’er remember<br>
        Apollo’s summer look;<br>
        But with a sweet forgetting<br>
        They stay their crystal fretting,<br>
        Never, never petting<br>
        About the frozen time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah would ’twere so with many<br>
        A gentle girl and boy!<br>
        But were there ever any<br>
        Writhed not at passe´d joy?<br>
        To know the change and feel it,<br>
        When there is none to heal it<br>
        Nor numbe´d sense to steal it—<br>
        Was never said in rhyme.
      </p>

      <h2>Ode to a Nightingale</h2>

      <p>
        MY heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains<br>
          My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,<br>
        Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains<br>
          One minute past, and <span class="tooltip">Lethe<span class="tooltiptext">In Greek mythology, "Lethe" was a river in Hades (the Underworld) that made people forget all their memories if they drank from it.</span></span>-wards had sunk:<br>
        ’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,<br>
          But being too happy in thy happiness,—<br>
            That thou, light-winge´d <span class="tooltip">Dryad<span class="tooltiptext">a tree nymph or tree spirit in Greek mythology</span></span> of the trees,<br>
                In some melodious plot<br>
          Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,<br>
            Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        O, far a draught of vintage, that hath been<br>
          Cool’d a long age in the deep-delve´d earth,<br>
        Tasting of Flora and the country green,<br>
          Dance, and Provençal song, and sun-burnt mirth!<br>
        O for a beaker full of the warm South,<br>
          Full of the true, the blushful <span class="tooltip">Hippocrene<span class="tooltiptext">used to refer to poetic or literary inspiration; In Greek mythology, a fountain on Mount Helicon sacred to the Muses and believed to be a source of poetic inspiration</span></span>,<br>
            With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,<br>
                And purple-staine´d mouth;<br>
        That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,<br>
          And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
      </p>

      <p>
        Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget<br>
          What thou among the leaves hast never known,<br>
        The weariness, the fever, and the fret<br>
          Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;<br>
        Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,<br>
          Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;<br>
            Where but to think is to be full of sorrow<br>
                And leaden-eyed despairs;<br>
          Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,<br>
            Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Away! away! for I will fly to thee,<br>
          Not charioted by Bacchus and his <span class="tooltip">pards<span class="tooltiptext">leopards</span></span>,<br>
        But on the viewless wings of <span class="tooltip">Poesy<span class="tooltiptext">poetry; poetic inspiration</span></span>,<br>
          Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:<br>
        Already with thee! tender is the night,<br>
          And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,<br>
            Cluster’d around by all her starry <span class="tooltip">Fays<span class="tooltiptext">fairies</span></span>;<br>
                But here there is no light<br>
          Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown<br>
            Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways,
      </p>

      <p>
        I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,<br>
          Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,<br>
        But, in embalme´d darkness, guess each sweet<br>
          Wherewith the seasonable month endows<br>
        The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;<br>
          White hawthorn, and the pastoral <span class="tooltip">eglantine<span class="tooltiptext">another term for sweetbrier, a Eurasian wild rose with fragrant leaves and flowers.</span></span>;<br>
            Fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves;<br>
                And mid-May’s eldest child,<br>
          The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,<br>
            The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darkling I listen; and for many a time<br>
          I have been half in love with easeful Death,<br>
        Call’d him soft names in many a muse´d rhyme,<br>
          To take into the air my quiet breath;<br>
        Now more than ever seems it rich to die,<br>
          To cease upon the midnight with no pain,<br>
            While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad<br>
                In such an ecstasy!<br>
          Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—<br>
            To thy high requiem become a sod.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br>
          No hungry generations tread thee down;<br>
        The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br>
          In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br>
        Perhaps the self-same song that found a path<br>
          Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,<br>
            She stood in tears amid the alien corn;<br>
                The same that oft-times hath<br>
          Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam<br>
            Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forlorn! the very word is like a bell<br>
          To toll me back from thee to my sole self!<br>
        Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well<br>
          As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.<br>
        Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades<br>
          Past the near meadows, over the still stream,<br>
            Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep<br>
                In the next valley-glades:<br>
          Was it a vision, or a waking dream?<br>
            Fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?
      </p>

      <h2>Ode on a Grecian Urn</h2>

      <p>
        THOU still unravish’d bride of quietness,<br>
          Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,<br>
        <span class="tooltip">Sylvan<span class="tooltiptext">of, relating to, or inhabiting the woods; a mythical deity or spirit of the woods.</span></span> historian, who canst thus express<br>
          A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:<br>
        What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape<br>
          Of deities or mortals, or of both<br>
            In Tempe or the <span class="tooltip">dales<span class="tooltiptext">a valley, especially a broad valley.</span></span> of Arcady?<br>
          What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?<br>
        What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?<br>
            What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
      </p>

      <p>
        Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard<br>
          Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;<br>
        Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,<br>
          Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:<br>
        Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave<br>
          Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;<br>
            Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,<br>
        Though winning near the goal—yet, do not grieve;<br>
            She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,<br>
          For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed<br>
          Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;<br>
        And, happy melodist, unwearièd,<br>
          For ever piping songs for ever new;<br>
        More happy love! more happy, happy love!<br>
          For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,<br>
            For ever panting and for ever young;<br>
        All breathing human passion far above,<br>
          That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d,<br>
            A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who are these coming to the sacrifice?<br>
          To what green altar, O mysterious priest,<br>
        Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,<br>
          And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?<br>
        What little town by river or sea-shore,<br>
          Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,<br>
            Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?<br>
        And, little town, thy streets for evermore<br>
          Will silent be; and not a soul, to tell<br>
            Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.
      </p>

      <p>
        O Attic shape! fair attitude! with brede<br>
          Of marble men and maidens overwrought,<br>
        With forest branches and the trodden weed;<br>
          Thou, silent form! dost tease us out of thought<br>
        As doth eternity. Cold Pastoral!<br>
          When old age shall this generation waste,<br>
            Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe<br>
          Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say’st,<br>
        ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all<br>
            Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.’
      </p>

      <h2>Ode to Autumn</h2>

      <p>
        SEASON of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>
        Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br>
        Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>
        With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;<br>
        To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,<br>
        And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br>
        To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br>
        With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br>
        And still more, later flowers for the bees,<br>
        Until they think warm days will never cease;<br>
        For Summer has o’erbrimm’d their clammy cells.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who hath not seen Thee oft amid thy store?<br>
        Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<br>
        Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<br>
        Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<br>
        Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,<br>
        Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br>
        Spares the next swath and all its twine´d flowers:<br>
        And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep<br>
        Steady thy laden head across a brook;<br>
        Or by a cider-press, with patient look,<br>
        Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?<br>
        Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,<br>
        While barre´d clouds bloom the soft-dying day<br>
        And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<br>
        Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br>
        Among the river-sallows, borne aloft<br>
        Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<br>
        And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<br>
        Hedge-crickets sing, and now with treble soft<br>
        The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft;<br>
        And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
      </p>

      <h2>Ode to Psyche</h2>

      <p>
        O GODDESS! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung<br>
          By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,<br>
        And pardon that thy secrets should be sung<br>
            Even into thine own soft-conchèd ear:<br>
        Surely I dream’d to-day, or did I see<br>
          The wingèd Psyche with awaken’d eyes?<br>
        I wander’d in a forest thoughtlessly,<br>
          And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,<br>
        Saw two fair creatures, couchèd side by side<br>
          In deepest grass, beneath the whisp’ring roof<br>
            Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran<br>
                A brooklet, scarce espied:<br>
        ’Mid hush’d, cool-rooted flowers fragrant-eyed,<br>
          Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian,<br>
        They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass;<br>
          Their arms embracèd, and their <span class="tooltip">pinions<span class="tooltiptext">the outer part of a bird's wing including the flight feathers.</span></span> too;<br>
          Their lips touch’d not, but had not bade adieu,<br>
        As if disjoinèd by soft-handed slumber,<br>
        And ready still past kisses to outnumber<br>
          At tender eye-dawn of <span class="tooltip">aurorean<span class="tooltiptext">Belonging to the dawn, or resembling it in brilliant hue</span></span> love:<br>
                The wingèd boy I knew;<br>
          But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove?<br>
                His Psyche true!
      </p>

      <p>
        O latest-born and loveliest vision far<br>
          Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy!<br>
        Fairer than Phœbe’s sapphire-region’d star,<br>
          Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;<br>
        Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,<br>
                Nor altar heap’d with flowers;<br>
        Nor Virgin-choir to make delicious moan<br>
                Upon the midnight hours;<br>
        No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet<br>
          From chain-swung <span class="tooltip">censer<span class="tooltiptext">a container in which incense is burned, typically during a religious ceremony.</span></span> teeming;<br>
        No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat<br>
          Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.
      </p>

      <p>
        O brightest! though too late for antique vows,<br>
            Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,<br>
        When holy were the haunted forest boughs,<br>
          Holy the air, the water, and the fire;<br>
        Yet even in these days so far retired<br>
          From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,<br>
          Fluttering among the faint Olympians,<br>
        I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.<br>
        So let me be thy choir, and make a moan<br>
                Upon the midnight hours;<br>
        Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet<br>
          From swingèd censer teeming:<br>
        Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat<br>
          Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane<br>
          In some untrodden region of my mind,<br>
        Where branchèd thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,<br>
          Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind:<br>
        Far, far around shall those dark-cluster’d trees<br>
          Fledge the wild-ridgèd mountains steep by steep;<br>
        And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,<br>
          The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull’d to sleep;<br>
        And in the midst of this wide quietness<br>
        A rosy sanctuary will I dress<br>
        With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain,<br>
          With buds, and bells, and stars without a name,<br>
        With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,<br>
          Who, breeding flowers, will never breed the same;<br>
        And there shall be for thee all soft delight<br>
            That shadowy thought can win,<br>
        A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,<br>
            To let the warm Love in!
      </p>

      <h2>Ode on Melancholy</h2>

      <p>
        NO, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist<br>
          Wolf’s-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;<br>
        Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kist<br>
          By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;<br>
        Make not your rosary of yew-berries,<br>
          Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be<br>
            Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl<br>
        A partner in your sorrow’s mysteries;<br>
          For shade to shade will come too drowsily,<br>
            And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when the melancholy fit shall fall<br>
          Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,<br>
        That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,<br>
          And hides the green hill in an April shroud;<br>
        Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,<br>
        Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,<br>
          Or on the wealth of globèd <span class="tooltip">peonies<span class="tooltiptext">a herbaceous or shrubby plant of north temperate regions, which has long been cultivated for its showy flowers.</span></span>;<br>
            Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,<br>
          Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,<br>
            And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;<br>
          And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips<br>
        Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,<br>
          Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:<br>
        Ay, in the very temple of Delight<br>
          Veil’d Melancholy has her sovran shrine,<br>
            Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue<br>
        Can burst Joy’s grape against his palate fine;<br>
          His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,<br>
            And be among her cloudy trophies hung.
      </p>
