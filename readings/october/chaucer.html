        WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote <br>
        The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote,<br>
        And bathed every veyne in swich licour,<br>
        Of which vertu engendred is the flour;<br>
        Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth<br>
        Inspired hath in every holt and heeth<br>
        The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne<br>
        Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,<br>
        And smale fowles maken melodye,<br>
        That slepen al the night with open ye,<br>
        (So priketh hem nature in hir corages:<br>
        Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,<br>
        And palmers for to seken straunge strondes,<br>
        To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;<br>
        And specially, from every shires ende<br>
        Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,<br>
        The holy blisful martir for to seke,<br>
        That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bifel that, in that sesoun on a day,<br>
      In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay<br>
      Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage<br>
      To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,<br>
      At night was come in-to that hostelrye<br>
      Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye,<br>
      Of sondry folk, by aventure y-falle<br>
      In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle,<br>
      That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde;<br>
      The chambres and the stables weren wyde,<br>
      And wel we weren esed atte beste.<br>
      And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,<br>
      So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,<br>
      That I was of hir felawshipe anon,<br>
      And made forward erly for to ryse,<br>
      To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse.
      </p>

      <p>
        But natheles, whyl I have tyme and space,<br>
      Er that I ferther in this tale pace,<br>
      Me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun,<br>
      To telle yew al the condicioun<br>
      Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,<br>
      And whiche they weren, and of what degree;<br>
      And eek in what array that they were inne:<br>
      And at a knight than wol I first biginne.
      </p>

      <p>
        A KNIGHT ther was, and that a worthy man,<br>
      That fro the tyme that he first bigan<br>
      To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,<br>
      Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.<br>
      Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,<br>
      And thereto hadde he riden (no man ferre)<br>
      As wel in cristendom as hethenesse,<br>
      And evere honoured for his worthinesse.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Alisaundre he was, whan it was wonne;<br>
      Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne<br>
      Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce.<br>
      In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,<br>
      No cristen man so ofte of his degree.<br>
      In Gernade at the sege eek hadde he be<br>
      Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye.<br>
      At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye,<br>
      Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See<br>
      At many a noble aryve hadde he be,<br>
      At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,<br>
      And foughten for our feith at Tramissene<br>
      In listes thryes, and ay slayn his foo.<br>
      This ilke worthy knight hadde been also<br>
      Somtyme with the lord of Palatye,<br>
      Ageyn another hethen in Turkye:<br>
      And everemore he hadde a sovereyn prys.<br>
      And though that he were worthy, he was wys,<br>
      And of his port as meek as is a mayde.<br>
      He nevere yet no vileinye ne sayde<br>
      In al his lyf, un-to no maner wight.<br>
      He was a verray parfit gentil knight.<br>
      But for to tellen yow of his array,<br>
      His hors were goode, but he was nat gay.<br>
      Of fustian he wered a gipoun<br>
      Al bismotered with his habergeoun.<br>
      For he was late y-come from his viage,<br>
      And wente for to doon his pilgrimage.
      </p>

      <p>
        With him ther was his sone, a yong SQUYER,<br>
      A lovyer, and a lusty bacheler,<br>
      With lokkes crulle, as they were leyd in presse.<br>
      Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.<br>
      Of his stature he was of evene lengthe,<br>
      And wonderly delivere, and greet of strengthe.<br>
      And he hadde been somtyme in chivachye,<br>
      In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Picardye,<br>
      And born him wel, as of so litel space,<br>
      In hope to stonden in his lady grace.<br>
      Embrouded was he, as it were a mede<br>
      Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and rede.<br>
      Singinge he was, or floytinge, al the day;<br>
      He was as fresh as is the month of May.<br>
      Short was his goune, with sleves longe and wyde.<br>
      Wel coude he sitte on hors, and faire ryde.<br>
      He coude songes make and wel endyte,<br>
      Iuste and eek daunce, and wel purtreye and wryte.<br>
      So hote he lovede, that by nightertale<br>
      He sleep namore than doth a nightingale.<br>
      Curteys he was, lowly, and servisable,<br>
      And carf biforn his fader at the table.<br>
      A YEMAN hadde he, and servaunts namo<br>
      At that tyme, for him liste ryde so;<br>
      And he was clad in cote and hood of grene;<br>
      A sheef of pecok arwes brighte and kene<br>
      Under his belt he bar ful thriftily,<br>
      (Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:<br>
      His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),<br>
      And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe.<br>
      A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage.<br>
      Of wode-craft wel coude he al the usage.<br>
      Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,<br>
      And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,<br>
      And on that other syde a gay daggere,<br>
      Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere;<br>
      A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene<br>
      An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;<br>
      A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ther was also a Nonne, a PRIORESSE,<br>
      That of hir smyling was ful simple and coy;<br>
      Hir gretteste ooth was but by seynt Loy;<br>
      And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.<br>
      Ful wel she song the service divyne,<br>
      Entuned in hir nose ful semely;<br>
      And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,<br>
      After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,<br>
      For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe.<br>
      At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle;<br>
      She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,<br>
      Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.<br>
      Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,<br>
      That no drope ne fille up-on hir brest.<br>
      In curteisye was set ful moche hir lest.<br>
      Hir over lippe wyped she so clene,<br>
      That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene<br>
      Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.<br>
      Ful semely after hir mete she raughte,<br>
      And sikerly she was of greet disport,<br>
      And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port,<br>
      And peyned hir to countrefete chere<br>
      Of court, and been estatlich of manere,<br>
      And to ben holden digne of reverence.<br>
      But, for to speken of hir conscience,<br>
      She was so charitable and so pitous,<br>
      She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous<br>
      Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.<br>
      Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde<br>
      With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel breed.<br>
      But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,<br>
      Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:<br>
      And al was conscience and tendre herte.<br>
      Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was;<br>
      Hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas;<br>
      Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed;<br>
      But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed.<br>
      It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;<br>
      For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.<br>
      Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.<br>
      Of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar<br>
      A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;<br>
      And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene,<br>
      On which ther was first write a crowned A,<br>
      And after, Amor vincit omnia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another NONNE with hir hadde she,<br>
      That was hir chapeleyne, and PREESTES thre.
      </p>

      <p>
        A MONK ther was, a fair for the maistrye,<br>
      An out-rydere, that lovede venerye;<br>
      A manly man, to been an abbot able.<br>
      Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable:<br>
      And, whan he rood, men mighte his brydel here<br>
      Ginglen in a whistling wynd as clere,<br>
      And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle,<br>
      Ther-as this lord was keper of the celle.<br>
      The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,<br>
      By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,<br>
      This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,<br>
      And held after the newe world the space.<br>
      He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,<br>
      That seith, that hunters been nat holy men;<br>
      Ne that a monk, whan he is cloisterlees<br>
      Is likned til a fish that is waterlees;<br>
      This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre.<br>
      But thilke text held he nat worth an oistre.<br>
      And I seyde his opinioun was good.<br>
      What sholde he studie, and make him-selven wood,<br>
      Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,<br>
      Or swinken with his handes, and laboure,<br>
      As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?<br>
      Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.<br>
      Therfor he was a pricasour aright;<br>
      Grehoundes he hadde, as swifte as fowel in flight;<br>
      Of priking and of hunting for the hare<br>
      Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.<br>
      I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond<br>
      With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;<br>
      And, for to festne his hood under his chin,<br>
      He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin:<br>
      A love-knot in the gretter ende ther was.<br>
      His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,<br>
      And eek his face, as he hadde been anoint.<br>
      He was a lord ful fat and in good point;<br>
      His eyen stepe, and rollinge in his heed,<br>
      That stemed as a forneys of a leed;<br>
      His botes souple, his hors in greet estaat.<br>
      Now certeinly he was a fair prelat;<br>
      He was nat pale as a for-pyned goost.<br>
      A fat swan loved he best of any roost.<br>
      His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.
      </p>

      <p>
        A FRERE ther was, a wantown and a merye,<br>
      A limitour, a ful solempne man.<br>
      In alle the ordres foure is noon that can<br>
      So moche of daliaunce and fair langage.<br>
      He hadde maad ful many a mariage<br>
      Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.<br>
      Un-to his ordre he was a noble post.<br>
      Ful wel biloved and famulier was he<br>
      With frankeleyns over-al in his contree,<br>
      And eek with worthy wommen of the toun:<br>
      For he had power of confessioun,<br>
      As seyde him-self, more than a curat,<br>
      For of his ordre he was licentiat.<br>
      Ful swetely herde he confessioun,<br>
      And plesaunt was his absolucioun;<br>
      He was an esy man to yeve penaunce<br>
      Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce;<br>
      For unto a povre ordre for to yive<br>
      Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive.<br>
      For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,<br>
      He wiste that a man was repentaunt.<br>
      For many a man so hard is of his herte,<br>
      He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte.<br>
      Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres,<br>
      Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.<br>
      His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves<br>
      And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves.<br>
      And certeinly he hadde a mery note;<br>
      Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.<br>
      Of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys.<br>
      His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys;<br>
      Ther-to he strong was as a champioun.<br>
      He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,<br>
      And everich hostiler and tappestere<br>
      Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;<br>
      For un-to swich a worthy man as he<br>
      Acorded nat, as by his facultee,<br>
      To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.<br>
      It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce<br>
      For to delen with no swich poraille,<br>
      But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.<br>
      And over-al, ther-as profit sholde aryse,<br>
      Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.<br>
      Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous.<br>
      He was the beste beggere in his hous;<br>
      For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,<br>
      So plesaunt was his “In principio”,<br>
      Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.<br>
      His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.<br>
      And rage he coude as it were right a whelpe.<br>
      In love-dayes ther coude he mochel helpe.<br>
      For ther he was nat lyk a cloisterer,<br>
      With a thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler,<br>
      But he was lyk a maister or a pope.<br>
      Of double worsted was his semi-cope,<br>
      That rounded as a belle out of the presse.<br>
      Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,<br>
      To make his English swete up-on his tonge;<br>
      And in his harping, whan that he had songe,<br>
      His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,<br>
      As doon the sterres in the frosty night.<br>
      This worthy limitour was cleped Huberd.
      </p>

      <p>
        A MARCHANT was ther with a forked berd,<br>
      In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat,<br>
      Up-on his heed a Flaundrish bever hat;<br>
      His botes clasped faire and fetisly.<br>
      His resons he spak ful solempnely,<br>
      Sowninge alway thencrees of his winning.<br>
      He wolde the see were kept for any thing<br>
      Bitwixe Middleburgh and Orewelle.<br>
      Wel coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.<br>
      This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette;<br>
      Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette,<br>
      So estatly was he of his governaunce,<br>
      With his bargaynes, and with his chevisaunce.<br>
      For sothe he was a worthy man with-alle,<br>
      But sooth to seyn, I noot how men him calle.
      </p>

      <p>
        A CLERK ther was of Oxenford also,<br>
      That un-to logik hadde longe y-go,<br>
      As lene was his hors as is a rake,<br>
      And he nas nat right fat, I undertake;<br>
      But loked holwe, and ther-to soberly.<br>
      Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;<br>
      For he had geten him yet no benefice,<br>
      Ne was so worldly for to have office.<br>
      For him was levere have at his beddes heed<br>
      Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed<br>
      Of Aristotle and his philosophye,<br>
      Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrye.<br>
      But al be that he was a philosophre,<br>
      Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;<br>
      But al that he mighte of his frendes hente,<br>
      On bokes and on lerninge he it spente<br>
      And bisily gan for the soules preye<br>
      Of hem that yaf him wher-with to scoleye.<br>
      Of studie took he most cure and most hede,<br>
      Noght o word spak he more than was nede,<br>
      And that was seyd in forme and reverence,<br>
      And short and quik, and ful of hy sentence.<br>
      Sowninge in moral vertu was his speche,<br>
      And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.
      </p>

      <p>
        A SERGEANT OF THE LAWE, war and wys,<br>
      That often hadde been at the parvys,<br>
      Ther was also, ful riche of excellence.<br>
      Discreet he was, and of greet reverence:<br>
      He seemed swich, his wordes weren so wyse,<br>
      Iustice he was ful often in assyse,<br>
      By patente, and by pleyn commissioun;<br>
      For his science, and for his heigh renoun<br>
      Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.<br>
      So greet a purchasour was nowher noon.<br>
      Al was fee simple to him in effect,<br>
      His purchasing mighte nat been infect.<br>
      Nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas,<br>
      And yet he semed bisier than he was.<br>
      In termes hadde he caas and domes alle,<br>
      That from the tyme of king William were falle.<br>
      Therto he oude endyte, and make a thing,<br>
      Ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting;<br>
      And every statut coude he pleyn by rote.<br>
      He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote<br>
      Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;<br>
      Of his array telle I no lenger tale.
