        <span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he first of our society is a gentleman of Worcestershire</span>, of an ancient descent, a baronet, his name Sir Roger de
Coverley. His great-grandfather was inventor of that famous
country-dance which is called after him. All who know that shire are very well acquainted with the parts and merits of Sir Roger.
He is a gentleman that is very singular in his behavior, but his
singularities proceed from his good sense, and are contradictions to the manners of the world, only as he thinks the world is in the wrong. However, this humor creates him no enemies, for he does
nothing with sourness or obstinacy; and his being unconfined to modes and forms makes him but the readier and more capable to please and oblige all who know him. When he is in town he lives in Soho Square. It is said he keeps himself a bachelor by reason he was crossed in love by a perverse beautiful widow of the next county
to him. Before this disappointment, Sir Roger was what you call a fine gentleman, had often supped with my Lord Rochester and
Sir George Etherege, fought a duel upon his first coming to town,
and kicked bully Dawson in a public coffee-house for calling him
youngster. But being ill-used by the above-mentioned widow, he was
very serious for a year and a half; and though, his temper being
naturally jovial, he at last got over it, he grew careless of himself
and never dressed afterwards. He continues to wear a coat and
doublet of the same cut that were in fashion at the time of his
repulse, which, in his merry humors, he tells us, has been in and
out twelve times since he first wore it. It is said Sir Roger grew
humble in his desires after he had forgot his cruel beauty, insomuch
that it is reported he has frequently offended with beggars and gypsies; but this is looked upon, by his friends, rather as matter of
raillery than truth. He is now in his fifty-sixth year, cheerful, gay, and hearty; keeps a good house both in town and country; a great lover of mankind; but there is such a mirthful cast in his behavior,
that he is rather beloved than esteemed. His tenants grow rich, his servants look satisfied, all the young women profess love to him,
and the young men are glad of his company. When he comes into a house, he calls the servants by their names, and talks all the way
upstairs to a visit. I must not omit that Sir Roger is a justice of the quorum; that he fills the chair at a quarter-session with great
abilities, and three months ago gained universal applause, by explaining a passage in the Game Act.

        The gentleman next in esteem and authority among us is another
bachelor, who is a member of the Inner Temple, a man of great
probity, wit, and understanding; but he has chosen his place of residence rather to obey the direction of an old humorsome father than in pursuit of his own inclinations. He was placed there to study
the laws of the land, and is the most learned of any of the house in those of the stage. Aristotle and Longinus are much better understood
by him than Littleton or Coke. The father sends up every
post questions relating to marriage-articles, leases, and tenures, in the neighborhood; all which questions he agrees with an attorney to answer and take care of in the lump. He is studying the passions
themselves, when he should be inquiring into the debates among
men which arise from them. He knows the argument of each of the orations of Demosthenes and Tully, but not one case in the reports of our own courts. No one ever took him for a fool; but none,
except his intimate friends, know he has a great deal of wit. This
turn makes him at once both disinterested and agreeable. As few
of his thoughts are drawn from business, they are most of them fit for conversation. His taste for books is a little too just for the age he
lives in; he has read all, but approves of very few. His familiarity
with the customs, manners, actions, and writings of the ancients,
makes him a very delicate observer of what occurs to him in the
present world. He is an excellent critic, and the time of the play is his hour of business; exactly at five he passes through New-Inn,
crosses through Russell-court, and takes a turn at Will's till the play begins; he has his shoes rubbed and his periwig powdered at the
barber's as you go into the Rose. It is for the good of the audience
when he is at the play, for the actors have an ambition to please him.

        The person of next consideration is Sir Andrew Freeport, a merchant of great eminence in the city of London; a person of
indefatigable industry, strong reason, and great experience. His
notions of trade are noble and generous, and (as every rich man has
usually some sly way of jesting, which would make no great figure were he not a rich man) he calls the sea the British Common. He
is acquainted with commerce in all its parts, and will tell you that
it is a stupid and barbarous way to extend dominion by arms; for true power is to be got by arts and industry. He will often argue
that, if this part of our trade were well cultivated, we should gain
from one nation; and if another, from another. I have heard him
prove that diligence makes more lasting acquisitions than valor, and
that sloth has ruined more nations than the sword. He abounds in
several frugal maxims, amongst which the greatest favorite is, "A
penny saved is a penny got." A general trader of good sense is pleasanter company than a general scholar; and Sir Andrew having
a natural unaffected eloquence, the perspicuity of his discourse gives the same pleasure that wit would in another man. He has made his fortune himself; and says that England may be richer than other kingdoms by as plain methods as he himself is richer than other
men; though at the same time I can say this of him, that there is not a point in the compass but blows home a ship in which he is an
owner.

        Next to Sir Andrew in the clubroom sits Captain Sentry, a gentleman
of great courage, good understanding, but invincible modesty.
He is one of those that deserve very well, but are very awkward at putting their talents within the observation of such as should take
notice of them. He was some years a captain, and behaved himself
with great gallantry in several engagements and at several sieges;
but having a small estate of his own, and being next heir to Sir Roger, he has quitted a way of life in which no man can rise suitably
to his merit, who is not something of a courtier as well as a soldier.
I have heard him often lament that, in a profession where merit
is placed in so conspicuous a view, impudence should get the better of modesty. When he has talked to this purpose, I never heard him
make a sour expression, but frankly confess that he left the world
because he was not fit for it. A strict honesty and an even regular
behavior are in themselves obstacles to him that must press through
crowds, who endeavor at the same end with himself, the favor of a commander. He will, however, in his way of talk excuse generals
for not disposing according to men's dessert, or inquiring into it;
for, says he, that great man who has a mind to help me has as many
to break through to come to me as I have to come at him: therefore he will conclude that the man who would make a figure, especially in a military way, must get over all false modesty, and assist his patron against the importunity of other pretenders, by a proper
assurance in his own vindication. He says it is a civil cowardice to be
backward in asserting what you ought to expect, as it is a military
fear to be slow in attacking when it is your duty. With this candor
does the gentleman speak of himself and others. The same frankness
runs through all his conversation. The military part of his life has furnished him with many adventures, in the relation of which
he is very agreeable to the company; for he is never overbearing,
though accustomed to command men in the utmost degree below
him; nor ever too obsequious, from an habit of obeying men highly
above him.

        But that our society may not appear a set of humorists, unacquainted with the gallantries and pleasures of the age, we have
amongst us the gallant Will Honeycomb, a gentleman who, according to his years, should be in the decline of his life; but having ever been very careful of his person, and always had a very easy fortune,
time has made but a very little impression either by wrinkles on his forehead, or traces on his brain. His person is well turned, and of a good height. He is very ready at that sort of discourse with which
men usually entertain women. He has all his life dressed very well,
and remembers habits as others do men. He can smile when one
speaks to him, and laughs easily. He knows the history of every mode, and can inform you from which of the French king's wenches
our wives and daughters had this manner of curling their hair, that way of placing their hoods; whose frailty was covered by such a sort of a petticoat, and whose vanity to show her foot made that
part of the dress so short in such a year. In a word, all his conversation
and knowledge have been in the female world. As other men of his age will take notice to you what such a minister said upon such and such an occasion, he will tell you when the Duke of Monmouth danced at court, such a woman was then smitten, another
was taken with him at the head of his troop in the park. In
all these important relations, he has ever about the same time received a kind glance, or a blow of a fan from some celebrated beauty, mother
of the present Lord Such-a-one. If you speak of a young commoner
that said a lovely thing in the House, he starts up, "He has good
blood in his veins; Tom Mirable begot him; the rogue cheated me
in that affair; that young fellow's mother used me more like a dog
than any woman I ever made advances to." This way of talking of
his very much enlivens the conversation among us of a more sedate
turn, and I find there is not one of the company, but myself, who
rarely speak at all, but speaks of him as of that sort of a man who is usually called a well-bred fine gentleman. To conclude his character,
where women are not concerned, he is an honest worthy man.
      </p>

      <p>
        I cannot tell whether I am to account him, whom I am next to speak of, as one of our company; for he visits us but seldom, but
when he does, it adds to every man else a new enjoyment of himself. He is a clergyman, a very philosophic man, of general learning, great
sanctity of life, and the most exact good breeding. He has the misfortune
to be of a very weak constitution, and consequently cannot
accept of such cares and business as preferments in his function
would oblige him to; he is therefore among divines what a chamber counsellor
is among lawyers. The probity of his mind, and the
integrity of his life, create him followers, as being eloquent or loud
advances others. He seldom introduces the subject he speaks upon;
but we are so far gone in years that he observes, when he is among
us, an earnestness to have him fall on some divine topic, which he
always treats with much authority, as one who has no interest in
this world, as one who is hastening to the object of all his wishes, and
conceives hope from his decays and infirmities. These are my
ordinary companions.
