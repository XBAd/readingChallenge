      <h2>Act I</h2>

      <h2>Scene II</h2>

      <em>[Enter] ORDER, AMBLE, FURNACE, and WATCHALL</em>

      <p>
        ORD.  Set all things right, or, as my name is Order, <br>
      And by this staff of office that commands you,<br>
      This chain and double ruff, symbols of power,<br>
      Whoever misses in his function,<br>
      For one whole week makes forfeiture of his breakfast,<br>
      And privilege in the wine-cellar.<br>
        AMB.        You are merry,<br>
      Good master steward.<br>
        FURN.        Let him; I’ll be angry.<br>
        AMB.  Why, fellow Furnace, ’tis not twelve o’clock yet,<br>
      Nor dinner taking up; then, ’tis allow’d,<br>
      Cooks, by their places, may be choleric.<br>
        FURN.  You think you have spoke wisely, goodman Amble,<br>
      My lady’s go-before!<br>
        ORD.        Nay, nay, no wrangling.<br>
        FURN.  Twit me with the authority of the kitchen!<br>
      At all hours, and all places, I’ll be angry;<br>
      And thus provok’d, when I am at my prayers<br>
      I will be angry.<br>
        AMB.        There was no hurt meant.<br>
        FURN.  I am friends with thee; and yet I will be angry.<br>
        ORD.  With whom?<br>
        FURN.        No matter whom: yet, now I think on it,<br>
      I am angry with my lady.<br>
        WATCH.        Heaven forbid, man!<br>
        ORD.  What cause has she given thee?<br>
        FURN.        Cause enough, master steward.<br>
      I was entertain’d by her to please her palate,<br>
      And, till she forswore eating, I perform’d it.<br>
      Now, since our master, noble Allworth, died,<br>
      Though I crack my brains to find out tempting sauces,<br>
      And raise fortifications in the pastry<br>
      Such as might serve for models in the Low Countries;<br>
      Which, if they had been practised at Breda,<br>
      Spinola might have thrown his cap at it, and ne’er took it—<br>
        AMB.  But you had wanted matter there to work on.<br>
        FURN.  Matter! with six eggs, and a strike of rye meal,<br>
      I had kept the town till doomsday, perhaps longer.<br>
        ORD.  But what’s this to your pet against my lady?<br>
        FURN.  What’s this? Marry this: when I am three parts roasted<br>
      And the fourth part parboil’d, to prepare her viands,<br>
      She keeps her chamber, dines with a panada<br>
      Or water-gruel, my sweat never thought on.<br>
        ORD.  But your art is seen in the dining-room.<br>
        FURN.        By whom?<br>
      By such as pretend love to her, but come<br>
      To feed upon her. Yet, of all the harpies<br>
      That do devour her, I am out of charity<br>
      With none so much as the thin-gutted squire<br>
      That’s stolen into commission.<br>
        ORD.        Justice Greedy?<br>
        FURN.  The same, the same; meat’s cast away upon him,<br>
      It never thrives; he holds this paradox,<br>
      Who eats not well, can ne’er do justice well.<br>
      His stomach’s as insatiate as the grave,<br>
      Or strumpet’s ravenous appetites.  Knocking.<br>
        WATCH.        One knocks.
      </p>

      <em>Enter ALLWORTH</em>

      <p>
        ORD.  Our late young master!<br>
        AMB.        Welcome, sir.<br>
        FURN.        Your hand;<br>
      If you have a stomach, a cold bake-meat’s ready.<br>
        ORD.  His father’s picture in little.<br>
        FURN.        We are all your servants.<br>
        AMB.  In you he lives.<br>
        ALL.        At once, my thanks to all;<br>
      This is yet some comfort. Is my lady stirring?
      </p>

      <em>Enter LADY ALLWORTH, Waiting Woman, and Chambermaid</em>

      <p>
        ORD.  Her presence answers for us.<br>
        L. ALL.        Sort those silks well.<br>
      I’ll take the air alone.  Exeunt Waiting Woman and Chambermaid.<br>
        FURN.        You air and air;<br>
      But will you never taste but spoon-meat more?<br>
      To what use serve I?<br>
        L. ALL.        Prithee, be not angry;<br>
      I shall ere long: i’ the mean time, there is gold<br>
      To buy thee aprons, and a summer suit.<br>
        FURN.  I am appeas’d, and Furnace now grows cool.<br>
        L. ALL.  And, as I gave directions, if this morning<br>
      I am visited by any, entertain ’em<br>
      As heretofore; but say, in my excuse,<br>
      I am indispos’d.<br>
        ORD.        I shall, madam.<br>
        L. ALL.        Do, and leave them.<br>
      Nay, stay you, Allworth.  Exeunt ORDER, AMBLE, FURNACE, and WATCHALL.<br>
        ALL.        I shall gladly grow here,<br>
      To wait on your commands.<br>
        L. ALL.        So soon turn’d courtier!<br>
        ALL.  Style not that courtship, madam, which is duty<br>
      Purchas’d on your part.<br>
        L. ALL.        Well, you shall o’ercome;<br>
      I’ll not contend in words. How is it with<br>
      Your noble master?<br>
        ALL.        Ever like himself,<br>
      No scruple lessen’d in the full weight of honour.<br>
      He did command me, pardon my presumption,<br>
      As his unworthy deputy, to kiss<br>
      Your ladyship’s fair hands.<br>
        L. ALL.        I am honour’d in<br>
      His favour to me. Does he hold his purpose<br>
      For the Low Countries?<br>
        ALL.        Constantly, good madam;<br>
      But he will in person first present his service.<br>
        L. ALL.  And how approve you of his course? You are yet<br>
      Like virgin parchment, capable of any<br>
      Inscription, vicious or honourable.<br>
      I will not force your will, but leave you free<br>
      To you own election.<br>
        ALL.        Any form you please,<br>
      I will put on; but, might I make my choice,<br>
      With humble emulation I would follow<br>
      The path my lord marks to me.<br>
        L. ALL.        ’Tis well answer’d,<br>
      And I commend your spirit. You had a father,<br>
      Blest be his memory! that some few hours<br>
      Before the will of Heaven took him from me,<br>
      Who did commend you, by the dearest ties<br>
      Of perfect love between us, to my charge;<br>
      And, therefore, what I speak, you are bound to hear<br>
      With such respect as if he liv’d in me.<br>
      He was my husband, and howe’er you are not<br>
      Son of my womb, you may be of my love,<br>
      Provided you deserve it.<br>
        ALL.        I have found you,<br>
      Most honour’d madam, the best mother to me;<br>
      And, with my utmost strengths of care and service,<br>
      Will labour that you never may repent<br>
      Your bounties shower’d upon me.<br>
        L. ALL.        I much hope it.<br>
      These were your father’s words: “If e’er my son<br>
      Follow the war, tell him it is a school<br>
      Where all the principles tending to honour<br>
      Are taught, if truly followed: but for such<br>
      As repair thither as a place in which<br>
      They do presume they may with license practise<br>
      Their lusts and riots, they shall never merit<br>
      The noble name of soldiers. To dare boldly,<br>
      In a fair cause, and for their country’s safety,<br>
      To run upon the cannon’s mouth undaunted;<br>
      To obey their leaders, and shun mutinies;<br>
      To bear with patience the winter’s cold<br>
      And summer’s scorching heat, and not to faint,<br>
      When plenty of provision fails, with hunger;<br>
      Are the essential parts make up a soldier,<br>
      Not swearing, dice, or drinking.”<br>
        ALL.        There’s no syllable<br>
      You speak, but is to me an oracle,<br>
      Which but to doubt were impious.<br>
        L. ALL.        To conclude:<br>
      Beware ill company, for often men<br>
      Are like to those with whom they do converse;<br>
      And, from one man I warn you, and that’s Wellborn:<br>
      Not ’cause he’s poor, that rather claims your pity;<br>
      But that he’s in his manners so debauch’d,<br>
      And hath to vicious courses sold himself.<br>
      ’Tis true, your father lov’d him, while he was<br>
      Worthy the loving; but if he had liv’d<br>
      To have seen him as he is, he had cast him off,<br>
      As you must do.<br>
        ALL.        I shall obey in all things.<br>
        L. ALL.  Follow me to my chamber, you shall have gold<br>
      To furnish you like my son, and still supplied,<br>
      As I hear from you.<br>
        ALL.        I am still your creature.  Exeunt.

      <h2>Scene III</h2>

      <em>[Enter] OVERREACH, GREEDY, ORDER, AMBLE, FURNACE, WATCHALL, and MARRALL</em>

      <p>
        GREEDY.  Not to be seen!<br>
        OVER.        Still cloistered up! Her reason,<br>
      I hope, assures her, though she make herself<br>
      Close prisoner ever for her husband’s loss,<br>
      “Twill not recover him.<br>
        ORD.        Sir, it is her will,<br>
      Which we, that are her servants, ought to serve,<br>
      And not dispute. Howe’er, you are nobly welcome;<br>
      And, if you please to stay, that you may think so,<br>
      There came, not six days since, from Hull, a pipe<br>
      Of rich Canary, which shall spend itself<br>
      For my lady’s honour.<br>
        GREEDY.        Is it of the right race?<br>
        ORD.  Yes, Master Greedy.<br>
        AMB.        How his mouth runs o’er?<br>
        FURN.  I’ll make it run, and run. Save your good worship!<br>
        GREEDY.  Honest Master Cook, thy hand; again, how I love thee!<br>
      Are the good dishes still in being? Speak, boy.<br>
        FURN.  If you have a mind to feed, there is a chine<br>
      Of beef, well seasoned.<br>
        GREEDY.        Good!<br>
        FURN.        A pheasant, larded.<br>
        GREEDY.  That I might now give thanks for’t!<br>
        FURN.        Other kickshaws.<br>
      Besides, there came last night, from the forest of Sherwood,<br>
      The fattest stag I ever cook’d.<br>
        GREEDY.        A stag, man!<br>
        FURN.  A stag, sir; part of it prepar’d for dinner,<br>
      And bak’d in puff-paste.<br>
        GREEDY.        Puff-paste too! Sir Giles,<br>
      A ponderous chine of beef! a pheasant larded!<br>
      And red deer too, Sir Giles, and bak’d in puff-paste!<br>
      All business set aside, let us give thanks here.<br>
        FURN.  How the lean skeletons rapt!<br>
        OVER.        You know we cannot.<br>
        MAR.  Your worships are to sit on a commission,<br>
      And if you fail to come, you lose the cause.<br>
        GREEDY.  Cause me no causes. I’ll prove’t, for such dinner,<br>
      We may put off a commission: you shall find it<br>
      Henrici decimo quarto.<br>
        OVER.        Fie, Master Greedy!<br>
      Will you lose me a thousand pounds for a dinner?<br>
      No more, for shame! We must forget the belly<br>
      When we think of profit.<br>
        GREEDY.        Well, you shall o’er-rule me;<br>
      I could ev’n cry now.—Do you hear, Master Cook,<br>
      Send but a corner of that immortal pasty,<br>
      And I, in thankfulness, will, by your boy,<br>
      Send you—a brace of three-pences.<br>
        FURN.        Will you be so prodigal?
      </p>

      <em>Enter WELLBORN</em>

      <p>
        OVER.  Remember me to your lady. Who have we here?<br>
        WELL.  You know me.<br>
        OVER.        I did once, but now I will not;<br>
      Thou art no blood of mine. Avaunt, thou beggar!<br>
      If ever thou presume to own me more,<br>
      I’ll have thee cag’d and whipp’d.<br>
        GREEDY.        I’ll grant the warrant.<br>
      Think of pie-corner, Furnace!  [Exeunt OVERREACH, GREEDY, and MARRALL.]<br>
        WATCH.        Will you out, sir?<br>
      I wonder how you durst creep in.<br>
        ORD.        This is rudeness.<br>
      And saucy impudence.<br>
        AMB.        Cannot you stay<br>
      To be serv’d, among your fellows, from the basket,<br>
      But you must needs press into the hall?<br>
        FURN.        Prithee, vanish<br>
      Into some outhouse, though it be the pigstye;<br>
      My scullion shall come to thee.
      </p>

      <em>Enter ALLWORTH</em>

      <p>
        WELL.        This is rare:<br>
      Oh, here’s Tom Allworth. Tom!<br>
        ALL.        We must be strangers;<br>
      Nor would I have you seen here for a million.  Exit.<br>
        WELL.  Better and better. He contemns me too!
      </p>

      <em>Enter Waiting Woman and Chambermaid</em>

      <p>
        WOMAN.  Foh, what a smell’s here! What thing’s this?<br>
        CHAM.        A creature<br>
      Made out of the privy; let us hence, for love’s sake,<br>
      Or I shall swoon.<br>
        WOMAN.        I begin to feel faint already.  [Exeunt Waiting Woman and Chambermaid.]<br>
        WATCH.  Will you know your way;<br>
        AMB.        Or shall we teach it you,<br>
      By the head and shoulders?<br>
        WELL.        No; I will not stir;<br>
      Do you mark, I will not: let me see the wretch<br>
      That dares attempt to force me. Why, you slaves,<br>
      Created only to make legs, and cringe;<br>
      To carry in a dish, and shift a trencher;<br>
      That have not souls only to hope a blessing<br>
      Beyond black-jacks or flagons; you, that were born<br>
      Only to consume meat and drink, and batten<br>
      Upon reversions!—who advances? Who<br>
      Shews me the way?<br>
        ORD.        My lady!
      </p>

      <em>Enter LADY ALLWORTH, Waiting Woman, and Chambermaid</em>

      <p>
        CHAM.        Here’s the monster.<br>
        WOMAN.  Sweet madam, keep your glove to your nose.<br>
        CHAM.        Or let me<br>
      Fetch some perfumes may be predominant;<br>
      You wrong yourself else.<br>
        WELL.        Madam, my designs<br>
      Bear me to you.<br>
        L. ALL.        To me!<br>
        WELL.        And though I have met with<br>
      But ragged entertainment from your grooms here,<br>
      I hope from you to receive that noble usage<br>
      As may become the true friend of your husband,<br>
      And then I shall forget these.<br>
        L. ALL.        I am amaz’d<br>
      To see and hear this rudeness. Dar’st thou think,<br>
      Though sworn, that it can ever find belief,<br>
      That I, who to the best men of this country<br>
      Deni’d my presence since my husband’s death,<br>
      Can fall so low as to change words with thee?<br>
      Thou son of infamy, forbear my house,<br>
      And know and keep the distance that’s between us;<br>
      Or, though it be against my gentler temper,<br>
      I shall take order you no more shall be<br>
      An eyesore to me.<br>
        WELL.        Scorn me not, good lady;<br>
      But, as in form you are angelical,<br>
      Imitate the heavenly natures, and vouchsafe<br>
      At the least awhile to hear me. You will grant<br>
      The blood that runs in this arm is as noble<br>
      As that which fills your veins; those costly jewels,<br>
      And those rich clothes you wear, your men’s observance,<br>
      And women’s flattery, are in you no virtues,<br>
      Nor these rags, with my poverty, in me vices.<br>
      You have a fair fame, and, I know, deserve it;<br>
      Yet, lady, I must say, in nothing more<br>
      Than in the pious sorrow you have shewn<br>
      For your late noble husband.<br>
        ORD.        How she starts!<br>
        FURN.  And hardly can keep finger from the eye<br>
      To hear him nam’d.<br>
        L. ALL.        Have you aught else to say?<br>
        WELL.  That husband, madam, was once in his fortune<br>
      Almost as low as I; want, debts, and quarrels<br>
      Lay heavy on him: let it not be thought<br>
      A boast in me, though I say, I reliev’d him.<br>
      ’Twas I that gave him fashion; mine the sword,<br>
      That did on all occasions second his;<br>
      I brought him on and off with honour, lady;<br>
      And when in all men’s judgments he was sunk,<br>
      And, in his own hopes, not to be buoy’d up,<br>
      I stepp’d unto him, took him by the hand,<br>
      And set him upright.<br>
        FURN.        Are not we base rogues,<br>
      That could forget this?<br>
        WELL.        I confess, you made him<br>
      Master of your estate; nor could your friends,<br>
      Though he brought no wealth with him, blame you for it;<br>
      For he had a shape, and to that shape a mind<br>
      Made up of all parts, either great or noble:<br>
      So winning a behaviour, not to be<br>
      Resisted, madam.<br>
        L. ALL.        ’Tis most true, he had.<br>
        WELL.  For his sake, then, in that I was his friend,<br>
      Do not contemn me.<br>
        L. ALL.        For what’s past excuse me,<br>
      I will redeem it. Order, give the gentleman<br>
      A hundred pounds.<br>
        WELL.        No, madam, on no terms:<br>
      I will nor beg nor borrow sixpence of you,<br>
      But be suppli’d elsewhere, or want thus ever.<br>
      Only one suit I make, which you deny not<br>
      To strangers; and ’tis this.  Whispers to her.<br>
        L. ALL.        Fie! nothing else?<br>
        WELL.  Nothing, unless you please to charge your servants<br>
      To throw away a little respect upon me.<br>
        L. ALL.  What you demand is yours.<br>
        WELL.        I thank you, lady.<br>
      Now what can be wrought out of such a suit<br>
      Is yet in supposition: I have said all;<br>
      When you please, you may retire.—  [Exit LADY ALL.]<br>
      Nay, all’s forgotten;  [To the Servants.]<br>
      And, for a lucky omen to my projects,<br>
      Shake hands, and end all quarrels in the cellar.<br>
        ORD.  Agreed, agreed.<br>
        FURN.        Still merry Master Wellborn.  Exeunt.
