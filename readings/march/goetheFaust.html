      <h3>NIGHT</h3>

      <em>A high vaulted narrow Gothic chamber. FAUST, restless, seated at his desk.</em>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        I HAVE, alas! Philosophy,<br>
        Medicine, Jurisprudence too,<br>
        And to my cost Theology,<br>
        With ardent labour, studied through.<br>
        And here I stand, with all my lore,<br>
        Poor fool, no wiser than before.<br>
        Magister, doctor styled, indeed,<br>
        Already these ten years I lead,<br>
        Up, down, across, and to and fro,<br>
        My pupils by the nose,—and learn,<br>
        That we in truth can nothing know!<br>
        That in my heart like fire doth burn.<br>
        ’Tis true I’ve more cunning than all your dull tribe,<br>
        Magister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe;<br>
        Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me,<br>
        Neither can devil nor hell now appal me—<br>
        Hence also my heart must all pleasure forego!<br>
        I may not pretend, aught rightly to know,<br>
        I may not pretend, through teaching, to find<br>
        A means to improve or convert mankind.<br>
        Then I have neither goods nor treasure,<br>
        No worldly honour, rank, or pleasure;<br>
        No dog in such fashion would longer live!<br>
        Therefore myself to magic I give,<br>
        In hope, through spirit-voice and might,<br>
        Secrets now veiled to bring to light,<br>
        That I no more, with aching brow,<br>
        Need speak of what I nothing know;<br>
        That I the force may recognise<br>
        That binds creation’s inmost energies;<br>
        Her vital powers, her embryo seeds survey,<br>
        And fling the trade in empty words away.<br>
        O full-orb’d moon, did but thy rays<br>
        Their last upon mine anguish gaze!<br>
        Beside this desk, at dead of night,<br>
        Oft have I watched to hail thy light:<br>
        Then, pensive friend! o’er book and scroll,<br>
        With soothing power, thy radiance stole!<br>
        In thy dear light, ah, might I climb,<br>
        Freely, some mountain height sublime,<br>
        Round mountain caves with spirits ride,<br>
        In thy mild haze o’er meadows glide,<br>
        And, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew<br>
        My spirit, in thy healing dew!<br>
        Woe’s me! still prison’d in the gloom<br>
        Of this abhorr’d and musty room!<br>
        Where heaven’s dear light itself doth pass,<br>
        But dimly through the painted glass!<br>
        Hemmed in by volumes thick with dust,<br>
        Worm-eaten, hid ’neath rust and mould,<br>
        And to the high vault’s topmost bound,<br>
        A smoke-stained paper compassed round;<br>
        With boxes round thee piled, and glass,<br>
        And many a useless instrument,<br>
        With old ancestral lumber blent—<br>
        This is thy world! a world! alas!<br>
        And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart,<br>
        With tighten’d pressure in thy breast?<br>
        Why the dull ache will not depart,<br>
        By which thy life-pulse is oppress’d?<br>
        Instead of nature’s living sphere,<br>
        Created for mankind of old,<br>
        Brute skeletons surround thee here,<br>
        And dead men’s bones in smoke and mould.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up! Forth into the distant land!<br>
        Is not this book of mystery<br>
        By Nostradamus’ proper hand,<br>
        An all-sufficient guide? Thou’lt see<br>
        The courses of the stars unroll’d;<br>
        When nature doth her thoughts unfold<br>
        To thee, thy soul shall rise, and seek<br>
        Communion high with her to hold,<br>
        As spirit doth with spirit speak!<br>
        Vain by dull poring to divine<br>
        The meaning of each hallow’d sign.<br>
        Spirits! I feel you hov’ring near;<br>
        Make answer, if my voice ye hear!
      </p>

      <em>(He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.)</em>

      <p>
        Ah! at this spectacle through every sense,<br>
        What sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing!<br>
        I feel new rapture, hallow’d and intense,<br>
        Through every nerve and vein with ardour glowing.<br>
        Was it a god who character’d this scroll,<br>
        The tumult in my spirit healing,<br>
        O’er my sad heart with rapture stealing,<br>
        And by a mystic impulse, to my soul,<br>
        The powers of nature all around revealing.<br>
        Am I a God? What light intense!<br>
        In these pure symbols do I see,<br>
        Nature exert her vital energy.<br>
        Now of the wise man’s words I learn the sense;

        <blockquote>
          “Unlock’d the spirit-world doth lie,<br>
          Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead!<br>
          Up scholar, lave, with courage high,<br>
          Thine earthly breast in the morning-red!”  (He contemplates the sign.)
        </blockquote>

        How all things live and work, and ever blending,<br>
        Weave one vast whole from Being’s ample range!<br>
        How powers celestial, rising and descending,<br>
        Their golden buckets ceaseless interchange!<br>
        Their flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging,<br>
        From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing,<br>
        Through the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!
      </p>

      <p>
        A wondrous show! but ah! a show alone!<br>
        Where shall I grasp thee, infinite nature, where?<br>
        Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon<br>
        Hang heaven and earth, from which the withered heart<br>
        For solace yearns, ye still impart<br>
        Your sweet and fostering tides—where are ye—where?<br>
        Ye gush, and must I languish in despair?  (He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives the sigh of the Earth-spirit.)
      </p>

      <p>
        How all unlike the influence of this sign!<br>
        Earth-spirit, thou to me art nigher,<br>
        E’en now my strength is rising higher,<br>
        E’en now I glow as with new wine;<br>
        Courage I feel, abroad the world to dare,<br>
        The woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear,<br>
        With storms to wrestle, brave the lightning’s glare,<br>
        And mid the crashing shipwreck not despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clouds gather over me—<br>
        The moon conceals her light—<br>
        The lamp is quench’d—<br>
        Vapours are rising—Quiv’ring round my head<br>
        Flash the red beams—Down from the vaulted roof<br>
        A shuddering horror floats,<br>
        And seizes me!<br>
        I feel it, spirit, prayer-compell’d, ’tis thou<br>
        Art hovering near!<br>
        Unveil thyself!<br>
        Ha! How my heart is riven now!<br>
        Each sense, with eager palpitation,<br>
        Is strain’d to catch some new sensation!<br>
        I feel my heart surrender’d unto thee!<br>
        Thou must! Thou must! Though life should be the fee!  (He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit. A ruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the flame.)

      <h3>SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
        Who calls me?
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST  (turning aside)</h3>

      <p>
        Dreadful shape!
      </p>

      <h3>SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
        With might,<br>
Thou hast compelled me to appear,<br>
Long hast been sucking at my sphere,<br>
And now—
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Woe’s me! I cannot bear thy sight!
      </p>

      <h3>SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
        To see me thou dost breathe thine invocation,<br>
        My voice to hear, to gaze upon my brow;<br>
        Me doth thy strong entreaty bow—<br>
        Lo! I am here!—What cowering agitation<br>
        Grasps thee, the demigod! Where’s now the soul’s deep cry?<br>
        Where is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv’d<br>
        And bore and cherished? which, with ecstacy,<br>
        To rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved?<br>
        Where art thou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound,<br>
        Who towards me press’d with energy profound?<br>
        Art thou he? Thou,—who by my breath art blighted,<br>
        Who, in his spirit’s depths affrighted,<br>
        Trembles, a crush’d and writhing worm!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Shall I yield, thing of flame, to thee?<br>
        Faust, and thine equal, I am he!
      </p>

      <h3>SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
        In the currents of life, in action’s storm,

        <blockquote>
          I float and I wave<br>
          With billowy motion!<br>
          Birth and the grave<br>
          A limitless ocean,<br>
          A constant weaving<br>
          With change still rife,<br>
          A restless heaving,<br>
          A glowing life—
        </blockquote>

        Thus time’s whirring loom unceasing I ply,<br>
        And weave the life-garment of deity.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Thou, restless spirit, dost from end to end<br>
        O’ersweep the world; how near I feel to thee!
      </p>

      <h3>SPIRIT</h3>

      <p>
        Thou’rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend,<br>
        Not me!  (Vanishes.)
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Not thee?<br>
        Whom then?<br>
        I, Gods own image!<br>
        And not rank with thee!  (A knock.)<br>
        Oh death! I know it—’tis my famulus—<br>
        My fairest fortune now escapes!<br>
        That all these visionary shapes<br>
        A soulless groveller should banish thus! (WAGNER in his dressing gown and night-cap, a lamp in his hand. FAUST turns round reluctantly.)
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        Pardon! I heard you here declaim;<br>
        A Grecian tragedy you doubtless read?<br>
        Improvement in this art is now my aim,<br>
        For now-a-days it much avails. Indeed<br>
        An actor, oft I’ve heard it said, as teacher,<br>
        May give instruction to a preacher.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Ay, if your priest should be an actor too,<br>
        As not improbably may come to pass.
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        When in his study pent the whole year through,<br>
        Man views the world, as through an optic glass,<br>
        On a chance holiday, and scarcely then,<br>
        How by persuasion can he govern men?
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        If feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow<br>
        Fresh from the spirit’s depths, with strong control<br>
        Swaying to rapture every listener’s soul,<br>
        Idle your toil; the chase you may forego!<br>
        Brood o’er your task! Together glue,<br>
        Cook from another’s feast your own ragout,<br>
        Still prosecute your paltry game,<br>
        And fan your ash-heaps into flame!<br>
        Thus children’s wonder you’ll excite,<br>
        And apes’, if such your appetite;<br>
        But that which issues from the heart alone,<br>
        Will bend the hearts of others to your own.
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        The speaker in delivery will find<br>
        Success alone; I still am far behind.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        A worthy object still pursue!<br>
        Be not a hollow tinkling fool!<br>
        Sound understanding, judgment true,<br>
        Find utterance without art or rule;<br>
        And when in earnest you are moved to speak,<br>
        Then is it needful cunning words to seek?<br>
        Your fine harangues, so polish’d in their kind,<br>
        Wherein the shreds of human thought ye twist,<br>
        Are unrefreshing as the empty wind,<br>
        Whistling through wither’d leaves and autumn mist!
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        Oh God! How long is art,<br>
        Our life how short! With earnest zeal<br>
        Still as I ply the critic’s task, I feel<br>
        A strange oppression both of head and heart.<br>
        The very means how hardly are they won,<br>
        By which we to the fountains rise!<br>
        And haply, ere one half the course is run,<br>
        Check’d in his progress, the poor devil dies.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Parchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll<br>
        Waters, he thirsteth not who once hath quaffed?<br>
        Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul,<br>
        Thou has not won the life-restoring draught.
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        Your pardon! ’tis delightful to transport<br>
        Oneself into the spirit of the past,<br>
        To see in times before us how a wise man thought,<br>
        And what a glorious height we have achieved at last.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Ay truly! even to the loftiest star!<br>
        To us, my friend, the ages that are pass’d<br>
        A book with seven seals, close-fasten’d, are;<br>
        And what the spirit of the times men call,<br>
        Is merely their own spirit after all,<br>
        Wherein, distorted oft, the times are glass’d.<br>
        Then truly, ’tis a sight to grieve the soul!<br>
        At the first glance we fly it in dismay;<br>
        A very lumber-room, a rubbish-hole;<br>
        At best a sort of mock-heroic play,<br>
        With saws pragmatical, and maxims sage,<br>
        To suit the puppets and their mimic stage.
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        But then the world and man, his heart and brain!<br>
        Touching these things all men would something know.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Ay! what ’mong men as knowledge doth obtain!<br>
        Who on the child its true name dares bestow?<br>
        The few who somewhat of these things have known,<br>
        Who their full hearts unguardedly reveal’d,<br>
        Nor thoughts, nor feelings, from the mob conceal’d,<br>
        Have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown.—<br>
        Excuse me, friend, far now the night is spent,<br>
        For this time we must say adieu.
      </p>

      <h3>WAGNER</h3>

      <p>
        Still to watch on I had been well content,<br>
        Thus to converse so learnedly with you.<br>
        But as to-morrow will be Easter-day,<br>
        Some further questions grant, I pray;<br>
        With diligence to study still I fondly cling;<br>
        Already I know much, but would know everything.  (Exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST  (alone)</h3>

      <p>
        How him alone all hope abandons never,<br>
        To empty trash who clings, with zeal untired,<br>
        With greed for treasure gropes, and, joy-inspir’d,<br>
        Exults if earth-worms second his endeavour.
      </p>

      <p>
        And dare a voice of merely human birth,<br>
        E’en here, where shapes immortal throng’d intrude?<br>
        Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth,<br>
        For once, I e’en to thee feel gratitude.<br>
        Despair the power of sense did well-nigh blast,<br>
        And thou didst save me ere I sank dismay’d,<br>
        So giant-like the vision seem’d, so vast,<br>
        I felt myself shrink dwarf’d as I survey’d!
      </p>

      <p>
        I, God’s own image, from this toil of clay<br>
        Already freed, with eager joy who hail’d<br>
        The mirror of eternal truth unveil’d,<br>
        Mid light effulgent and celestial day:—<br>
        I, more than cherub, whose unfetter’d soul<br>
        With penetrative glance aspir’d to flow<br>
        Through nature’s veins, and, still creating, know<br>
        The life of gods,—how am I punish’d now!<br>
        One thunder-word hath hurl’d me from the goal!
      </p>

      <p>
        Spirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere.<br>
        What though my power compell’d thee to appear,<br>
        My art was powerless to detain thee here.<br>
        In that great moment, rapture-fraught,<br>
        I felt myself so small, so great;<br>
        Fiercely didst thrust me from the realm of thought<br>
        Back on humanity’s uncertain fate!<br>
        Who’ll teach me now? What ought I to forego?<br>
        Ought I that impulse to obey?<br>
        Alas! our every deed, as well as every woe,<br>
        Impedes the tenor of life’s onward way!
      </p>

      <p>
        E’en to the noblest by the soul conceiv’d,<br>
        Some feelings cling of baser quality;<br>
        And when the goods of this world are achiev’d,<br>
        Each nobler aim is termed a cheat, a lie.<br>
        Our aspirations, our soul’s genuine life,<br>
        Grow torpid in the din of earthly strife.<br>
        Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires,<br>
        Stretch o’er the infinite her wing sublime,<br>
        A narrow compass limits her desires,<br>
        When wreck’d our fortunes in the gulf of time.<br>
        In the deep heart of man care builds her nest,<br>
        O’er secret woes she broodeth there,<br>
        Sleepless she rocks herself and scareth joy and rest;<br>
        Still is she wont some new disguise to wear,<br>
        She may as house and court, as wife and child appear,<br>
        As dagger, poison, fire and flood;<br>
        Imagined evils chill thy blood,
      </p>

      <p>
        And what thou ne’er shall lose, o’er that dost shed the tear.<br>
        I am not like the gods! Feel it I must;<br>
        I’m like the earth-worm, writhing in the dust,<br>
        Which, as on dust it feeds, its native fare,<br>
        Crushed ’neath the passer’s tread, lies buried there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall,<br>
        With hundred shelves, confines me round;<br>
        Rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call<br>
        What in this moth-world doth my being bound?<br>
        Here, what doth fail me, shall I find?<br>
        Read in a thousand tomes that, everywhere,<br>
        Self-torture is the lot of human-kind,<br>
        With but one mortal happy, here and there?<br>
        Thou hollow skull, that grin, what should it say,<br>
        But that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed,<br>
        Still yearning for the truth, hath sought the light of day.<br>
        And in the twilight wandered, sorely vexed?<br>
        Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me,—<br>
        With wheel, and cog, and ring, and cylinder;<br>
        To nature’s portals ye should be the key;<br>
        Cunning your wards, and yet the bolts ye fail to stir.<br>
        Inscrutable in broadest light,<br>
        To be unveil’d by force she doth refuse,<br>
        What she reveals not to thy mental sight,<br>
        Thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws.<br>
        Old useless furnitures, yet stand ye here,<br>
        Because my sire ye served, now dead and gone.<br>
        Old scroll, the smoke of years dost wear,<br>
        So long as o’er this desk the sorry lamp hath shone.<br>
        Better my little means hath squandered quite away,<br>
        Than burden’d by that little here to sweat and groan!<br>
        Wouldst thou possess thy heritage, essay,<br>
        By use to render it thine own!<br>
        What we employ not, but impedes our way,<br>
        That which the hour creates, that can it use alone!<br>
        But wherefore to yon spot is riveted my gaze?<br>
        Is yonder flasket there a magnet to my sight?<br>
        Whence this mild radiance that around me plays,<br>
        As when, ’mid forest gloom, reigneth the moon’s soft light?
      </p>

      <p>
        Hail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe,<br>
        Down from thine old receptacle I draw!<br>
        Science in thee I hail and human art.<br>
        Essence of deadliest powers, refin’d and sure,<br>
        Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure,<br>
        Now in thy master’s need thy grace impart!<br>
        I gaze on thee, my pain is lull’d to rest;<br>
        I grasp thee, calm’d the tumult in my breast;<br>
        The flood-tide of my spirit ebbs away;<br>
        Onward I’m summon’d o’er a boundless main,<br>
        Calm at my feet expands the glassy plain,<br>
        To shores unknown allures a brighter day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion,<br>
        Comes floating towards me! I’m prepar’d to fly<br>
        By a new track through ether’s wide dominion,<br>
        To distant spheres of pure activity.<br>
        This life intense, this godlike ecstasy—<br>
        Worm that thou art such rapture canst thou earn?<br>
        Only resolve with courage stern and high,<br>
        Thy visage from the radiant sun to turn!<br>
        Dare with determin’d will to burst the portals<br>
        Past which in terror others fain would steal!<br>
        Now is the time, through deeds, to show that mortals<br>
        The calm sublimity of gods can feel;<br>
        To shudder not at yonder dark abyss,<br>
        Where phantasy creates her own self-torturing brood,<br>
        Right onward to the yawning gulf to press,<br>
        Around whose narrow jaws rolleth hell’s fiery flood;<br>
        With glad resolve to take the fatal leap,<br>
        Though danger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep!<br>
        Pure crystal goblet! forth I draw thee now,<br>
        From out thine antiquated case, where thou<br>
        Forgotten hast reposed for many a year!<br>
        Oft at my father’s revels thou didst shine,<br>
        To glad the earnest guests was thine,<br>
        As each to other passed the generous cheer.<br>
        The gorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought,<br>
        Which he who quaff’d must first in rhyme expound,<br>
        Then drain the goblet at one draught profound,<br>
        Hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought.<br>
        I to my neighbour shall not reach thee now,<br>
        Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show.<br>
        Here is a juice, makes drunk without delay;<br>
        Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill;<br>
        Let this last draught, the product of my skill,<br>
        My own free choice, be quaff’d with resolute will,<br>
        A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day!
      </p>
