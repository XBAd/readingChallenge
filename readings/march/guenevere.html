      <h2>The Defence of Guenevere</h2>

      <p>
        BUT, knowing now that they would have her speak, <br>
        She threw her wet hair backward from her brow,<br>
        Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,
      </p>

      <p>
        As though she had had there a shameful blow,<br>
        And feeling it shameful to feel aught but shame<br>
        All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,
      </p>

      <p>
      She must a little touch it; like one lame<br>
      She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head<br>
      Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame
      </p>

      <p>
      The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:<br>
      “O knights and lords, it seems but little skill<br>
      To talk of well-known things past now and dead.
      </p>

      <p>
      “God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,<br>
      And pray you all forgiveness heartily!<br>
      Because you must be right, such great lords; still
      </p>

      <p>
      “Listen, suppose your time were come to die,<br>
      And you were quite alone and very weak;<br>
      Yea, laid a dying while very mightily
      </p>

      <p>
      “The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak<br>
      Of river through your broad lands running well:<br>
      Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,<br>
      Now choose one cloth for ever; which they be,<br>
      I will not tell you, you must somehow tell
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!’<br>
      Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,<br>
      At foot of your familiar bed to see
      </p>

      <p>
      “A great God’s angel standing, with such dyes,<br>
      Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,<br>
      Held out two ways, light from the inner skies
      </p>

      <p>
      “Showing him well, and making his commands<br>
      Seem to be God’s commands, moreover, too,<br>
      Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;
      </p>

      <p>
      “And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,<br>
      Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;<br>
      No man could tell the better of the two.
      </p>

      <p>
      “After a shivering half-hour you said:<br>
      ‘God help! heaven’s color, the blue;’ and he said, ‘hell.’<br>
      Perhaps you would then roll upon your bed,
      </p>

      <p>
      “And cry to all good men that loved you well,<br>
      ‘Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;’<br>
      Launcelot went away, then I could tell,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,<br>
      And roll and hurt myself, and long to die,<br>
      And yet fear much to die for what was sown.
      </p>

      <p>
      “Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br>
      Whatever may have happened through these years,<br>
      God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.”
      </p>

      <p>
      Her voice was low at first, being full of tears,<br>
      But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,<br>
      Growing a windy shriek in all men’s ears,
      </p>

      <p>
      A ringing in their startled brains, until<br>
      She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,<br>
      And her great eyes began again to fill,
      </p>

      <p>
      Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk,<br>
      But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair!<br>
      Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,
      </p>

      <p>
      She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,<br>
      Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame,<br>
      With passionate twisting of her body there:
      </p>

      <p>
      “It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came<br>
      To dwell at Arthur’s court: at Christmastime<br>
      This happened; when the heralds sung his name,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Son of King Ban of Benwick, seemed to chime<br>
      Along with all the bells that rang that day,<br>
      O’er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.
      </p>

      <p>
      “Christmas and whitened winter passed away,<br>
      And over me the April sunshine came,<br>
      Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea
      </p>

      <p>
      “And in the Summer I grew white with flame,<br>
      And bowed my head down: Autumn, and the sick<br>
      Sure knowledge things would never be the same,
      </p>

      <p>
      “However often Spring might be most thick<br>
      Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew<br>
      Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,
      </p>

      <p>
      “To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through<br>
      My eager body; while I laughed out loud,<br>
      And let my lips curl up at false or true,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.<br>
      Behold, my judges, then the cloths were brought;<br>
      While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd
      </p>

      <p>
      “Belonging to the time ere I was bought<br>
      By Arthur’s great name and his little love;<br>
      Must I give up for ever then, I thought,
      </p>

      <p>
      “That which I deemed would ever round me move,<br>
      Glorifying all things; for a little word,<br>
      Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove
      </p>

      <p>
      “Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord<br>
      Will that all folks should be quite happy and good?<br>
      I love God now a little, if this cord
      </p>

      <p>
      “Were broken, once for all what striving could<br>
      Make me love anything in earth or heaven?<br>
      So day by day it grew, as if one should
      </p>

      <p>
      “Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,<br>
      Down to a cool sea on a summer day;<br>
      Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven
      </p>

      <p>
      “Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,<br>
      Until one surely reached the sea at last,<br>
      And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay
      </p>

      <p>
      “Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past<br>
      Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,<br>
      Washed utterly out by the dear waves o’ercast,
      </p>

      <p>
      “In the lone sea, far off from any ships!<br>
      Do I not know now of a day in Spring?<br>
      No minute of that wild day ever slip
      </p>

      <p>
      “From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,<br>
      And wheresoever I may be, straightway<br>
      Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:
      </p>

      <p>
      “I was half mad with beauty on that day,<br>
      And went without my ladies all alone,<br>
      In a quiet garden walled round every way;
      </p>

      <p>
      “I was right joyful of that wall of stone,<br>
      That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,<br>
      And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy<br>
      With wary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;<br>
      Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,
      </p>

      <p>
      “A little thing just then had made me mad;<br>
      I dared not think, as I was wont to do,<br>
      Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had
      </p>

      <p>
      “Held out my long hand up against the blue,<br>
      And, looking on the tenderly darken’d fingers,<br>
      Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,
      </p>

      <p>
      “There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers<br>
      Round by the edges; what should I have done,<br>
      If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,
      </p>

      <p>
      “And startling green drawn upward by the sun?<br>
      But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,<br>
      And trancedly stood watching the west wind run
      </p>

      <p>
      “With faintest half-heard breathing sound: why there<br>
      I lose my head e’en now in doing this;<br>
      But shortly listen: In that garden fair
      </p>

      <p>
      “Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss<br>
      Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,<br>
      I scarce dare talk of the remember’d bliss,
      </p>

      <p>
      “When both our mouths went wandering in one way,<br>
      And aching sorely, met among the leaves;<br>
      Our hands being left behind strained far away.
      </p>

      <p>
      “Never within a yard of my bright sleeves<br>
      Had Launcelot come before: and now so nigh!<br>
      After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?
      </p>

      <p>
      “Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br>
      Whatever happened on through all those years,<br>
      God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.
      </p>

      <p>
      “Being such a lady could I weep these tears<br>
      If this were true? A great queen such as I<br>
      Having sinn’d this way, straight her conscience sears;
      </p>

      <p>
      “And afterwards she liveth hatefully,<br>
      Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps:<br>
      Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Do I not see how God’s dear pity creeps<br>
      All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?<br>
      Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Buried in some place far down in the south<br>
      Men are forgetting as I speak to you;<br>
      By her head sever’d in that awful drouth
      </p>

      <p>
      “Of pity that drew Agravaine’s fell blow,<br>
      I pray your pity! let me not scream out<br>
      For ever after, when the shrill winds blow
      </p>

      <p>
      “Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout<br>
      For ever after in the winter night<br>
      When you ride out alone! in battle-rout
      </p>

      <p>
      “Let not my rusting tears make your sword light!<br>
      Ah! God of mercy, how he turns away!<br>
      So, ever must I dress me to the fight,
      </p>

      <p>
      “So: let God’s justice work! Gauwaine, I say,<br>
      See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know<br>
      Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,
      </p>

      <p>
      “One bitter day in la Fausse Garde, for so<br>
      All good knights held it after, saw:<br>
      Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though
      </p>

      <p>
      “You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw.<br>
      .  .  .  .  .  .  .
      </p>

      <p>
      “This very day, and you were judges here<br>
      Instead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce<br>
      When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear
      </p>

      <p>
      “Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,<br>
      His side sink in? as my knight cried and said:<br>
      ‘Slayer of unarm’d men, here is a chance!
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,<br>
      By God I am so glad to fight with you,<br>
      Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,<br>
      For all my wounds are moving in my breast,<br>
      And I am getting mad with waiting so.’
      </p>

      <p>
      “He struck his hands together o’er the beast,<br>
      Who fell down flat, and grovell’d at his feet,<br>
      And groan’d at being slain so young: ‘At least,
      </p>

      <p>
      “My knight said, ‘Rise you, sir, who are so fleet<br>
      At catching ladies, half-arm’d will I fight,<br>
      My left side all uncovered!’ then I weet,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight<br>
      Upon his knave’s face; not until just then<br>
      Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight
      </p>

      <p>
      “Along the lists look to my stake and pen<br>
      With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh<br>
      From agony beneath my waist-chain, when
      </p>

      <p>
      “The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;<br>
      Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,<br>
      And traversed warily, and ever high
      </p>

      <p>
      “And fast leapt caitiff’s sword, until my knight<br>
      Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,<br>
      Caught it and swung it; that was all the fight;
      </p>

      <p>
      “Except a spout of blood on the hot land,<br>
      For it was hottest summer; and I know<br>
      I wonder’d how the fire, while I should stand,
      </p>

      <p>
      “And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,<br>
      Yards above my head; thus these matters went,<br>
      Which things were only warnings of the woe
      </p>

      <p>
      “That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,<br>
      For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;<br>
      Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent
      </p>

      <p>
      “With all his wickedness; say no rash word<br>
      Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes<br>
      Wept all away to gray, may bring some sword
      </p>

      <p>
      “To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise<br>
      Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;<br>
      And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,
      </p>

      <p>
      “Yea also at my full heart’s strong command,<br>
      See through my long throat how the words go up<br>
      In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand
      </p>

      <p>
      “The shadow lies like wine within a cup<br>
      Of marvellously color’d gold; yea now<br>
      This little wind is rising, look you up,
      </p>

      <p>
      “And wonder how the light is falling so<br>
      Within my moving tresses: will you dare<br>
      When you have looked a little on my brow,
      </p>

      <p>
      “To say this thing is vile? or will you care<br>
      For any plausible lies of cunning woof,<br>
      Where you can see my face with no lie there
      </p>

      <p>
      “For ever? am I not a gracious proof?—<br>
      ‘But in your chamber Launcelot was found’—<br>
      Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,
      </p>

      <p>
      “When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:<br>
      ‘O true as steel, come now and talk with me,<br>
      I love to see your step upon the ground
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘Unwavering, also well I love to see<br>
      That gracious smile light up your face, and hear<br>
      Your wonderful words, that all mean verily
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear<br>
      To me in everything, come here to-night,<br>
      Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘If you come not, I fear this time I might<br>
      Get thinking over much of times gone by,<br>
      When I was young, and green hope was in sight:
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘For no man cares now to know why I sigh;<br>
      And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,<br>
      Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs<br>
      To see you, Launcelot; that we may be<br>
      Like children once again, free from all wrongs
      </p>

      <p>
      “‘Just for one night.’ Did he not come to me?<br>
      What thing could keep true Launcelot away<br>
      If I said, ‘Come?’ there was one less than three
      </p>

      <p>
      “In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;<br>
      Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick,<br>
      Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea
      </p>

      <p>
      “I looked at Launcelot’s face and could not speak,<br>
      For he looked helpless too, for a little while;<br>
      Then I remember how I tried to shriek,
      </p>

      <p>
      “And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile<br>
      The stones they threw up rattled o’er my head<br>
      And made me dizzier; till within a while
      </p>

      <p>
      “My maids were all about me, and my head<br>
      On Launcelot’s breast was being soothed away<br>
      From its white chattering, until Launcelot said:…
      </p>

      <p>
      “By God! I will not tell you more to-day,<br>
      Judge any way you will: what matters it?<br>
      You know quite well the story of that fray,
      </p>

      <p>
      “How Launcelot still’d their bawling, the mad fit<br>
      That caught up Gauwaine, all, all, verily,<br>
      But just that which would save me; these things flit.
      </p>

      <p>
      “Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br>
      Whatever may have happen’d these long years,<br>
      God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!
      </p>

      <p>
      “All I have said is truth, by Christ’s dear tears.”<br>
      She would not speak another word, but stood<br>
      Turn’d sideways; listening, like a man who hears
      </p>

      <p>
      His brother’s trumpet sounding through the wood<br>
      Of his foes’ lances. She leaned eagerly,<br>
      And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could
      </p>

      <p>
      At last hear something really; joyfully<br>
      Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed<br>
      Of the roan charger drew all men to see,<br>
      The knight who came was Launcelot at good need.
