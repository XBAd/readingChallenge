      <em>Enter ŒDIPUS</em>

      <p>
        ŒDIPUS;  WHY sit ye here, my children, brood last reared <br>
        Of Cadmus famed of old, in solemn state,<br>
        Uplifting in your hands the suppliants’ boughs?<br>
        And all the city reeks with incense smoke,<br>
        And all re-echoes with your wailing hymns;<br>
        And I, my children, counting it unmeet<br>
        To hear report from others, I have come<br>
        Myself, whom all name Œdipus the Great.—<br>
        Do thou, then, agèd Sire, since thine the right<br>
        To speak for these, tell clearly why ye stand<br>
        Awe-stricken, or adoring; speak to me<br>
        As willing helper. Dull and cold this heart<br>
        To see you prostrate thus, and feel no ruth.
      </p>

      <p>
      PRIEST  Yes, Œdipus, thou ruler of my land,<br>
      Thou seest us how we sit, as suppliants, bowed<br>
      Around thine altars; some as yet unfledged<br>
      To wing their flight, and some weighed down with age.<br>
      Priest, I, of Zeus, and these the chosen youth:<br>
      And in the open spaces of the town<br>
      The people sit and wail, with wreath in hand,<br>
      By the twin shrine of Pallas, or the grove<br>
      Oracular that bears Ismenus’ name.<br>
      For this our city, as thine eyes may see,<br>
      Is sorely tempest-tossed, nor lifts its head<br>
      From out the surging sea of blood-flecked waves,<br>
      All smitten in the fruitful blooms of earth,<br>
      All smitten in the herds that graze the fields,<br>
      Yea, and in timeless births of woman’s fruit;<br>
      And still the God sends forth his darts of fire,<br>
      And lays us low. The plague, abhorred and feared,<br>
      Makes desolate the home where Cadmus dwelt,<br>
      And Hades dark grows rich in sighs and groans.<br>
      It is not that we count thee as a God,<br>
      Equalled with them in power, that we sit here,<br>
      These little ones and I, as suppliants prone;<br>
      But, judging thee, in all life’s shifting scenes,<br>
      Chiefest of men, yea, and of chiefest skill,<br>
      To soothe the powers of Heaven. For thou it was<br>
      That freed’st this city, named of Cadmus old,<br>
      From the sad tribute which of yore we paid<br>
      To that stern songstress, all untaught of us,<br>
      And all unprompted; but at God’s behest,<br>
      Men think and say, thou guidest all our life.<br>
      And now, O Œdipus, most honoured lord,<br>
      We pray thee, we, thy suppliants, find for us<br>
      Some succour, whether floating voice of God,<br>
      Or speech of man brings knowledge to thy soul;<br>
      For still I see, with those whom life has trained<br>
      To long-tried skill, the issues of their thoughts<br>
      Live and are mighty. Come, then, noblest one,<br>
      Come, save our city; look on us, and fear.<br>
      As yet this land, for all thy former zeal,<br>
      Calls thee its saviour: do not give us cause<br>
      So to remember this thy reign, as men<br>
      Who, having risen, then fall low again;<br>
      But save us, save our city. Omens good<br>
      Were then with thee; thou didst thy work, and now<br>
      Be equal to thyself! If thou wilt rule,<br>
      As thou dost rule, this land wherein we dwell,<br>
      ’Twere better far to reign o’er living men<br>
      Than o’er a realm dispeopled. Naught avails,<br>
      Or tower or ship, when crew and guards are gone.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  O children, wailing loud, ye tell me not<br>
      Of woes unknown; too well I know them all,<br>
      Your sorrows and your wants. For one and all<br>
      Are stricken, yet no sorrow like to mine<br>
      Weighs on you. Each his own sad burden bears,<br>
      His own and not another’s. But my heart<br>
      Mourns for the people’s sorrow and mine own;<br>
      And, lo! ye have not come to break my sleep,<br>
      But found me weeping, weeping bitter tears,<br>
      And treading weary paths in wandering thought;<br>
      And that one way of healing which I found,<br>
      That have I acted on. Menœkeus’ son,<br>
      Creon, my kinsman, have I sent to seek<br>
      The Pythian home of Phœbus, there to learn<br>
      The words or deeds wherewith to save the state;<br>
      And even now I measure o’er the time<br>
      And wonder how he fares, for, lo! he stays,<br>
      I know not why, beyond the appointed day;<br>
      But when he comes I should be base indeed,<br>
      Failing to do whate’er the God declares.
      </p>

      <p>
      PRIEST  Well hast thou spoken! Tidings come e’en now<br>
      Of Creon seen approaching.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Grant, O King<br>
      Apollo, that he come with omen good,<br>
      Bright with the cheer of one that bringeth life.
      </p>

      <p>
      PRIEST  If one may guess, ’tis well. He had not come<br>
      His head all wreathed with boughs of laurel else.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Soon we shall know. Our voice can reach him now.<br>
      Say, prince, our well-beloved, Menœkeus’ son,<br>
      What sacred answer bring’st thou from the God?
      </p>

      <em>Enter CREON</em>

      <p>
      CREON.  A right good answer! That our evil plight,<br>
      If all goes well, may end in highest good.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  What means this speech? Nor full of eager hope,<br>
      Nor trembling panic, list I to thy words.
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  I for my part am ready, these being by,<br>
      to tell thee all, or go within the gates.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Speak out to all. I sorrow more for them<br>
      Than for the woe which touches me alone.
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  Well, then, I speak the things the God declared.<br>
      Phœbus, our king, he bids us chase away<br>
      (The words were plain) the infection of our land,<br>
      Nor cherish guilt which still remains unhealed.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  But with what rites? And what the deed itself?
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  Drive into exile, blood for blood repay.<br>
      That guilt of blood is blasting all the state.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  But whose fate is it that thou hintest at?
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  Once, O my king, ere thou didst raise our state,<br>
      Our sovereign Laius ruled o’er all the land.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  This know I well, though him I never saw.
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  Well, then, the God commands us, he being dead,<br>
      To take revenge on those who shed his blood.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Yes; but where are they? How to track the course<br>
      Of guilt all shrouded in the doubtful past?
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  In this our land, so said he, those who seek<br>
      Shall find; unsought, we lose it utterly.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Was it at home, or in the field, or else<br>
      In some strange land that Laius met his doom?
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  He went, so spake he, pilgrim-wise afar,<br>
      And nevermore came back as forth he went.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Was there no courier, none who shared his road,<br>
      From whom, inquiring, one might learn the truth?
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  Dead are they all, save one who fled for fear,<br>
      And he had naught to tell but this:…
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  [interrupting] And what was that? One fact might teach us much,<br>
      Had we but one small starting-point of hope.
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  He used to tell that robbers fell on him,<br>
      Not man for man, but with outnumbering force.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Yet sure no robber would have dared this deed,<br>
      Unless some bribe had tempted him from hence.
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  So men might think; but Laius at his death<br>
      Found none to help, or ’venge him in his woe.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  What hindered you, when thus your sovereignty<br>
      Had fallen low, from searching out the truth?
      </p>

      <p>
      CREON.  The Sphinx, with her dark riddle, bade us look<br>
      At nearer facts, and leave the dim obscure.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Well, be it mine to track them to their source.<br>
      Right well hath Phœbus, and right well hast thou,<br>
      Shown for the dead your care, and ye shall find,<br>
      As is most meet, in me a helper true,<br>
      Aiding at once my country and the God.<br>
      Not for the sake of friends, or near or far,<br>
      But for mine own, will I dispel this curse;<br>
      For he that slew him, whosoe’er he be,<br>
      Will wish, perchance, with such a blow to smite<br>
      Me also. Helping him, I help myself.<br>
      And now, my children, rise with utmost speed<br>
      From off these steps, and raise your suppliant boughs;<br>
      And let another call my people here,<br>
      The race of Cadmus, and make known that I<br>
      Will do my taskwork to the uttermost:<br>
      So, as God wills, we prosper, or we fail.
      </p>

      <p>
      PRIEST  Rise, then, my children, ’twas for this we came,<br>
      For these good tidings which those lips have brought,<br>
      And Phœbus, he who sent these oracles,<br>
      Pray that he come to heal, and save from woe.  [Exeunt CREON and Priest.]
      </p>

      <h3>STROPH. I</h3>

      <p>
      CHORUS  O voice of Zeus sweet-toned, with what intent<br>
      Cam’st thou from Pytho, where the red gold shines,<br>
      To Thebes, of high estate?<br>
      Fainting for fear, I quiver in suspense<br>
      (Hear us, O healer! God of Delos, hear!),<br>
      In brooding dread, what doom, of present growth,<br>
      Or as the months roll on, thy hand will work;<br>
      Tell me, O Voice divine, thou child of golden hope!
      </p>

      <h3>ANTISTROPH. I</h3>

      <p>
      Thee first, Zeus-born Athene, thee I call;<br>
      And next thy sister, Goddess of our land,<br>
      Our Artemis, who in the market sits<br>
      In queenly pride, upon her orbed throne;<br>
      And Phœbus, the fair darter! O ye Three,<br>
      Shine on us, and deliver us from ill!<br>
      If e’er before, when waves or storms of woe<br>
      Rushed on our state, ye drove away<br>
      The fiery tide of ill,<br>
      Come also now!
      </p>

      <h3>STROPH. II</h3>

      <p>
      Yea, come, ye Gods, for sorrows numberless<br>
        Press on my soul;<br>
      And all the host is smitten, and our thoughts<br>
        Lack weapons to resist.<br>
      For increase fails of all the fruits of earth,<br>
      And women faint in childbirth’s wailing pangs,<br>
      And one by one, as flit the swift-winged birds,<br>
      So, flitting to the shore of Hades dark,<br>
      Fleeter than lightning’s flash,<br>
      Thou seest them passing on.
      </p>

      <h3>ANTISTROPH. II</h3>

      <p>
      Yea, numberless are they who perish thus,<br>
      And on the soil, plague-breeding, lie<br>
      Infants unpitied, cast out ruthlessly;<br>
      And wives and mothers, gray with hoary age,<br>
      Some here, some there, by every altar mourn,<br>
      With woe and sorrow crushed,<br>
      And chant their wailing plaint.<br>
      Clear thrills the sense their solemn litany,<br>
      And the low anthem sung in unison.<br>
      Hear, then, thou golden daughter of great Zeus,<br>
      And send us help, bright-faced as is the morn.
      </p>

      <h3>STROPH. III</h3>

      <p>
      And Ares the destroyer drive away!<br>
      Who now, though hushed the din of brazen shield,<br>
      With battle-cry wars on me fierce and hot.<br>
      Bid him go back in flight,<br>
      Retreat from this our land,<br>
      Or to the ocean bed,<br>
      Where Amphitrite sleeps,<br>
      Or to the homeless sea<br>
      Which sweeps the Thracian shore.<br>
      If waning night spares aught<br>
      That doth the day assail:<br>
      Do thou, then, Sire almighty,<br>
      Wielding the lightning’s strength,<br>
      Blast him with thy hot thunder.
      </p>

      <h3>ANTISTROPH. III</h3>

      <p>
      And thou, Lyceian king, the wolf’s dread foe,<br>
      Fain would I see thy darts<br>
      From out thy golden bow<br>
      Go forth invincible,<br>
      Helping and bringing aid;<br>
      And with them, winged with fire,<br>
      The rays of Artemis,<br>
      With which, on Lycian hills,<br>
      She moveth on her course.<br>
      And last I call on thee,<br>
      Thou of the golden crown,<br>
      Guardian of this our land,<br>
      Bacchus, all purple-flushed,<br>
      With clamour loud and long,<br>
      Wandering with Maenads wild;<br>
      I call on thee to come,<br>
      Flashing with blazing torch,<br>
      Against the God whom all the Gods disown.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Thou prayest, and for thy prayers, if thou wilt hear<br>
      My words, and treat the dire disease with skill,<br>
      Thou shalt find help and respite from thy pain,—<br>
      My words, which I, a stranger to report,<br>
      A stranger to the deed, will now declare:<br>
      For I myself should fail to track it far,<br>
      Unless some footprints guided me aright.<br>
      But now, since here I stand, the latest come,<br>
      A citizen to citizens, I speak<br>
      To all the sons of Cadmus. Lives there one<br>
      Who knows of Laitus, son of Labdacus,<br>
      The hand that slew him; him I bid to tell<br>
      His tale to me; and should it chance he shrinks,<br>
      Fearing the charge against himself to bring,<br>
      Still let him speak; no heavier doom is his<br>
      Than to depart uninjured from the land;<br>
      Or, if there be that knows an alien arm<br>
      As guilty, let him hold his peace no more;<br>
      I will secure his gain and thanks beside.<br>
      But if ye hold your peace, if one through fear<br>
      Shall stifle words his bosom friend may drop,<br>
      What then I purpose let him hear from me:<br>
      That man I banish, whosoe’er he be,<br>
      From out the land whose power and throne are mine;<br>
      And none may give him shelter, none speak to him,<br>
      Nor join with him in prayer and sacrifice,<br>
      Nor pour for him the stream that cleanses guilt;<br>
      But all shall thrust him from their homes, abhorred,<br>
      Our curse and our pollution, as the word<br>
      Prophetic of the Pythian God has shown:<br>
      Such as I am, I stand before you here,<br>
      A helper to the God and to the dead.<br>
      And for the man who did the guilty deed,<br>
      Whether alone he lurks, or leagued with more,<br>
      I pray that he may waste his life away,<br>
      For vile deeds vilely dying; and for me,<br>
      If in my house, I knowing it, he dwells,<br>
      May every curse I speak on my head fall.<br>
      And this I charge you do, for mine own sake,<br>
      And for the God’s, and for the land that pines,<br>
      Barren and god-deserted. Wrong ’twould be,<br>
      E’en if no voice from heaven had urged us on,<br>
      That ye should leave the stain of guilt uncleansed,<br>
      Your noblest chief, your king himself, being slain.<br>
      Yea, rather, seek and find. And since I reign,<br>
      Wielding the might his hand did wield before,<br>
      Filling his couch, and calling his wife mine,<br>
      Yea, and our children too, but for the fate<br>
      That fell on his, had grown up owned by both;<br>
      But so it is. On his head fell the doom;<br>
      And therefore will I strive my best for him,<br>
      As for my father, and will go all lengths<br>
      To seek and find the murderer, him who slew<br>
      The son of Labdacus, and Polydore,<br>
      And earlier Cadmus, and Agenor old;<br>
      And for all those who hearken not, I pray<br>
      The Gods to give then neither fruit of earth,<br>
      Nor seed of woman, but consume their lives<br>
      With this dire plague, or evil worse than this.<br>
      And you, the rest, the men from Cadmus sprung,<br>
      To whom these words approve themselves as good,<br>
      May righteousness befriend you, and the Gods,<br>
      In full accord, dwell with you evermore.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  Since thou hast bound me by a curse, O king,<br>
      I needs must speak. I neither slew the man,<br>
      Nor know who slew. To say who did the deed<br>
      Belongs to him who sent this oracle.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Right well thou speak’st, but man’s best strength must fail<br>
      To force the Gods to do the things they will not.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  And may I speak a second time my thoughts?
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  If ’twere a third, shrink not from speaking out.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  One man I know, a prince, whose insight deep<br>
      Sees clear as princely Phœbus, and from him,<br>
      Teiresias, one might learn, O king, the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  That, too, is done. No loiterer I in this,<br>
      For I have sent, on Creon’s hint, two bands<br>
      To summon him, and wonder that he comes not.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  Old rumours are there also, dark and dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  And what are they? I weigh the slightest word.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  ’Twas said he died by some chance traveller’s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  I, too, heard that. But none knows who was by.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  If yet his soul is capable of awe,<br>
      Hearing thy curses, he will shrink from them.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Words fright not him who, doing, knows no fear.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  Well, here is one who’ll put him to the proof.<br>
      For, lo! they bring the seer inspired of God;<br>
      Chosen of all men, vessel of the truth.
      </p>

      <em>Enter TEIRESIAS, blind, and guided by a boy</em>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Teiresias! thou whose mind embraceth all,<br>
      Told or untold, the things of heaven or earth;<br>
      Thou knowest, although thou seest not, what a pest<br>
      Dwells on us, and we find in thee, O prince,<br>
      Our one deliverer, yea, our only help.<br>
      For Phœbus (if, perchance, thou hast not heard)<br>
      Sent back this word to us, who sent to ask,<br>
      That this one way was open to escape<br>
      From the fell plague; if those who Laius slew,<br>
      We in our turn, discovering, should slay,<br>
      Or drive them forth as exiles from the land.<br>
      Thou, therefore, grudge not either sign from birds,<br>
      Or any other path of prophecy;<br>
      But save the city, save thyself, save me;<br>
      Lift off the guilt that death has left behind;<br>
      On thee we hang. To use our means, our power,<br>
      In doing good, is noblest service owned.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Ah me! ah me! how sad is wisdom’s gift,<br>
      When no good issue waiteth on the wise!<br>
      Right well I knew this, but in evil hour<br>
      Forgot, alas! or else I had not come.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  What means this? How despondingly thou com’st!
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Let me go home; for thus thy fate shalt thou,<br>
      And I mine own, bear easiest, if thou yield.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  No loyal words thou speak’st, nor true to Thebes<br>
      Who reared thee, holding back this oracle.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  It is because I see thy lips speak words<br>
      Ill-timed, ill-omened, that I guard my speech.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Now, by the Gods, unless thy reason fails,<br>
      Refuse us not, who all implore thy help.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Yes. Reason fails you all; but ne’er will I<br>
      So speak my sorrows as to unveil thine.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  What mean’st thou, then? Thou know’st and wilt not tell,<br>
      But giv’st to ruin both the state and us?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I will not pain myself nor thee. Why, then,<br>
      All vainly urge it? Thou shalt never know.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Oh, basest of the base! (for thou wouldst stir<br>
      A heart of stone;) and wilt thou never tell,<br>
      But still abide relentless and unmoved?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  My mood thou blamest, but thou dost not know<br>
      That which dwells with thee while thou chidest me.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  And who would not feel anger, as he hears<br>
      The words which bring dishonour to the state?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Well! come they will, though I should hold my peace.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  If come they must, thy duty is to speak.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I speak no more. So, if thou wilt, rage on,<br>
      With every mood of wrath most desperate.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Yes; I will not refrain, so fierce my wrath,<br>
      From speaking all my thought. I think that thou<br>
      Didst plot the deed, and do it, though the blow<br>
      Thy hands, it may be, dealt not. Hadst thou seen,<br>
      I would have said it was thy deed alone
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  And it has come to this? I charge thee, hold<br>
      To thy late edict, and from this day forth<br>
      Speak not to me, nor yet to these, for thou,<br>
      Thou art the accursèd plague-spot of the land.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Art thou so shameless as to vent such words,<br>
      And thinkest to escape thy righteous doom?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I have escaped. The strength of truth is mine.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Who prompted thee? This comes not from thine art.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Thou art the man. ’Twas thou who mad’st me speak.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  What say’st thou? Tell it yet again, that I<br>
      May know more clearly.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  When I spoke before,<br>
      Didst thou not know? Or dost thou challenge me?
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  I could not say I knew it. Speak again.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I say that thou stand’st there a murderer.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Thou shalt not twice revile, and go unharmed.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  And shall I tell thee more to stir thy rage?
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Say what thou pleasest. All in vain ’tis said.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I say that thou, in vilest intercourse<br>
      With those thou lovest best, dost blindly live,<br>
      Nor seest the evil thou hast made thine own.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  And dost thou think to say these things and live?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Of that I doubt not, if truth holds her own.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Truth is for all but thee, but thou hast none,<br>
      Blind in thine ears, thy reason, and thine eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  How wretched thou, thus hurling this reproach!<br>
      Such, all too soon, the world will hurl at thee.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Thou livest wrapt in one continual night,<br>
      And canst not hurt or me, or any man<br>
      Who sees the light.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Fate’s firm decree stands fixed:<br>
      Thou diest not by me. Apollo’s might<br>
      Suffices. His the task to bring thee low.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Are these devices Creon’s or thine own?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  It is not Creon harms thee, but thyself.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  O wealth, and sovereignty, and noblest skill<br>
      Surpassing skill in life that men admire,<br>
      How great the envy dogging all your steps!<br>
      If for the sake of kingship, which the state<br>
      Hath given, unasked for, freely in mine hands,<br>
      Creon the faithful, found mine earliest friend,<br>
      Now seeks with masked attack to drive me forth,<br>
      And hires this wizard, plotter of foul schemes,<br>
      A vagrant mountebank, whose sight is clear<br>
      For pay alone, but in his art stone-blind.<br>
      Is it not so? When wast thou known a seer?<br>
      Why, when the monster with her song was here,<br>
      Didst thou not give our countrymen thy help?<br>
      And yet the riddle lay above the ken<br>
      Of common men, and called for prophet’s skill.<br>
      And this thou show’dst thou hadst not, nor by bird,<br>
      Nor any God made known; but then I came,<br>
      I, Œdipus, who nothing knew, and slew her,<br>
      With mine own counsel winning, all untaught<br>
      By flight of birds. And now thou wouldst expel me,<br>
      And think’st to take thy stand by Creon’s throne.<br>
      But, as I think, both thou and he that plans<br>
      With thee, will to your cost attack my fame;<br>
      And but that thou stand’st there all old and weak,<br>
      Thou shouldst be taught what kind of plans are thine.
      </p>

      <p>
      CHORUS  Far as we dare to measure, both his words<br>
      And thine, O Œdipus, in wrath are said.<br>
      Not such as these we need, but this to see,<br>
      How best to do the bidding of the God.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  King though thou be, I claim an equal right<br>
      To make reply. Here I call no man lord:<br>
      For I am not thy slave, but Loxias’.<br>
      Nor shall I stand on Creon’s patronage;<br>
      And this I say, since thou hast dared revile<br>
      My blindness, that thou seest, yet dost not see<br>
      Thy evil plight, nor where thou liv’st, nor yet<br>
      With whom thou dwellest, Know’st thou even this,<br>
      Whence thou art sprung? All ignorant thou sinn’st<br>
      Against thine own, the living and the dead.<br>
      And soon a curse from mother and from sire<br>
      With fearful foot shall chase thee forth from us,<br>
      Now seeing all things clear, then all things dark.<br>
      And will not then each shore repeat thy wail,<br>
      And will not old Kithæron echoing ring<br>
      When thou discern’st the marriage, fatal port,<br>
      To which thy prosp’rous voyage brought thy bark?<br>
      And other ills, in countless multitude,<br>
      Thou seest not yet, on thee and on thy seed<br>
      Shall fall alike. Vent forth thy wrath then loud,<br>
      On Creon and on me. There lives not man<br>
      Who wastes his life more wretchedly than thou.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  This can be borne no longer! Out with thee!<br>
      A curse light on thee! Wilt thou not depart?<br>
      Wilt thou not turn and wend thy backward way?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I had not come hadst thou not called me here.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  I knew not thou wouldst speak so foolishly;<br>
      Else I had hardly fetched thee to my house.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  We then, for thee (so deemest thou), are fools,<br>
      But, for thy parents, who begot thee, wise.  [Turns to go.]
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  [starting forward] What? Stay thy foot. What mortal gave me<br>
      birth?
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  This day shall give thy birth, and work thy doom.


      <p>
      ŒDIP.  What riddles dark and dim thou lov’st to speak.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Yes. But thy skill excels in solving such.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Scoff as thou wilt, in this thou’lt find me strong.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  And yet success in this has worked thy fall.
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  I little care, if I have saved the state.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  Well, then, I go. Do thou, boy, lead me on!
      </p>

      <p>
      ŒDIP.  Let him lead on. So hateful art thou near,<br>
      Thou canst not pain me more when thou art gone.
      </p>

      <p>
      TEIR.  I go, then, having said the things I came<br>
      To say. No fear of thee compels me. Thine<br>
      Is not the power to hurt me. And I say,<br>
      This man whom thou art seeking out with threats,<br>
      As murderer of Laius, he is here,<br>
      In show an alien sojourner, but in truth<br>
      A home-born Theban. No delight to him<br>
      Will that discovery bring. Blind, having seen,<br>
      Poor, having rolled in wealth,—he, with a staff<br>
      Feeling his way, to other lands shall go!<br>
      And by his sons shall he be known at once<br>
      Father and brother, and of her who bore him<br>
      Husband and son, sharing his father’s bed,<br>
      His father’s murd’rer. Go thou, then, within,<br>
      And brood o’er this, and, if thou find’st me fail,<br>
      Say that my skill in prophecy is gone.  [Exeunt ŒDIPUS and TEIRESIAS.]
      </p>

      <h3>STROPH. I</h3>

      <p>
      CHORUS  Who was it that the rock oracular<br>
            Of Delphi spake of, working<br>
      With bloody hand his nameless deed of shame?<br>
            Time is it now for him,<br>
            Swifter than fastest steed,<br>
            To bend his course in flight.<br>
            For, in full armour clad,<br>
            Upon him darts, with fire<br>
      And lightning flash, the radiant Son of Zeus.<br>
      And with him come in train the dreaded ones,<br>
            The Destinies that may not be appeased.
