      <h2>XXI</h2>

      <p>
        BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: <br>
        “Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better<br>
        friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.<br>
        Each of us all must his end abide<br>
        in the ways of the world; so win who may<br>
        glory ere death! When his days are told,<br>
        that is the warrior’s worthiest doom.<br>
        Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,<br>
        and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.<br>
        No harbor shall hide her—heed my promise!—<br>
        enfolding of field or forested mountain<br>
        or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!<br>
        But thou this day endure in patience,<br>
        as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one.”<br>
        Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked,<br>
        mighty Lord, for the man’s brave words.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled<br>
        wave-maned steed. The sovran wise<br>
        stately rode on; his shield-armed men<br>
        followed in force. The footprints led<br>
        along the woodland, widely seen,<br>
        a path o’er the plain, where she passed, and trod<br>
        the murky moor; of men-at-arms<br>
        she bore the bravest and best one, dead,<br>
        him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.
      </p>

      <p>
        On then went the atheling-born<br>
      o’er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,<br>
      narrow passes and unknown ways,<br>
      headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.<br>
      Foremost he fared, a few at his side<br>
      of the wiser men, the ways to scan,<br>
      till he found in a flash the forested hill<br>
      hanging over the hoary rock,<br>
      a woful wood: the waves below<br>
      were dyed in blood. The Danish men<br>
      had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,<br>
      for many a hero, ’twas hard to bear,<br>
      ill for earls, when Æschere’s head<br>
      they found by the flood on the foreland there.<br>
      Waves were welling, the warriors saw,<br>
      hot with blood; but the horn sang oft<br>
      battle-song bold. The band sat down,<br>
      and watched on the water worm-like things,<br>
      sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,<br>
      and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness—<br>
      such as oft essay at hour of morn<br>
      on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest,—<br>
      and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,<br>
      swollen and savage that song to hear,<br>
      that war-horn’s blast. The warden of Geats,<br>
      with bolt from bow, then balked of life,<br>
      of wave-work, one monster; amid its heart<br>
      went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed<br>
      less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.<br>
      Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well<br>
      hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,<br>
      done to death and dragged on the headland,<br>
      wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed<br>
      the grisly guest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then girt him Beowulf<br>
in martial mail, nor mourned for his life.<br>
His breastplate broad and bright of hues,<br>
woven by hand, should the waters try;<br>
well could it ward the warrior’s body<br>
that battle should break on his breast in vain<br>
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.<br>
And the helmet white that his head protected<br>
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,<br>
through wave-whirl win: ’twas wound with chains,<br>
decked with gold, as in days of yore<br>
the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,<br>
with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,<br>
brandished in battle, could bite that helm.<br>
Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps<br>
which Hrothgar’s orator offered at need:<br>
“Hrunting” they named the hilted sword,<br>
of old-time heirlooms easily first;<br>
iron was its edge, all etched with poison,<br>
with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight<br>
in hero’s hand who held it ever,<br>
on paths of peril prepared to go<br>
to folkstead of foes. Not first time this<br>
it was destined to do a daring task.<br>
For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf<br>
sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,<br>
drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent<br>
to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not<br>
under welter of waters wager his life<br>
as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,<br>
honor of earls. With the other not so,<br>
who girded him now for the grim encounter.
      </p>

      <h2>XXII</h2>

      <p>
        BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:—<br>
        “Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene,<br>
        gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,<br>
        sovran wise, what once was said:<br>
        if in thy cause it came that I<br>
        should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide<br>
        to me, though fallen, in father’s place!<br>
        Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,<br>
        my warrior-friends, if War should seize me;<br>
        and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,<br>
        Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!<br>
        Geatland’s king may ken by the gold,<br>
        Hrethel’s son see, when he stares at the treasure,<br>
        that I got me a friend for goodness famed,<br>
        and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.<br>
        And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,<br>
        earl far-honored, this heirloom precious,<br>
        hard of edge: with Hrunting I<br>
        seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After these words the Weder-Geat lord<br>
        boldly hastened, biding never<br>
        answer at all: the ocean floods<br>
        closed o’er the hero. Long while of the day<br>
        fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.<br>
        Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain<br>
        sword-hungry held these hundred winters,<br>
        greedy and grim, that some guest from above,<br>
        some man, was raiding her monster-realm.<br>
        She grasped out for him with grisly claws,<br>
        and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not<br>
        his body hale; the breastplate hindered,<br>
        as she strove to shatter the sark of war,<br>
        the linkéd harness, with loathsome hand.<br>
        Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,<br>
        the lord of rings to the lair she haunted,<br>
        whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,<br>
        weapon to wield against wondrous monsters<br>
        that sore beset him; sea-beasts many<br>
        tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,<br>
        and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked<br>
        he was now in some hall, he knew not which,<br>
        where water never could work him harm,<br>
        nor through the roof could reach him ever<br>
        fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,<br>
        beams of a blaze that brightly shone.<br>
        Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,<br>
        mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke<br>
        he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.<br>
        Then sang on her head that seemly blade<br>
        its war-song wild. But the warrior found<br>
        the light-of-battle was loath to bite,<br>
        to harm the heart: its hard edge failed<br>
        the noble at need, yet had known of old<br>
        strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven,<br>
        doomed men’s fighting-gear. First time, this,<br>
        for the gleaming blade that its glory fell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firm still stood, nor failed in valor,<br>
      heedful of high deeds, Hygelac’s kinsman;<br>
      flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled,<br>
      the angry earl; on earth it lay<br>
      steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted.<br>
      hand-gripe of might. So man shall do<br>
      whenever in war he weens to earn him<br>
      lasting fame, nor fears for his life!<br>
      Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,<br>
      the Geatish war-prince Grendel’s mother.<br>
      Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,<br>
      his deadly foe, that she fell to ground.<br>
      Swift on her part she paid him back<br>
      with grisly grasp, and grappled with him.<br>
      Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,<br>
      fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.<br>
      On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,<br>
      broad and brown-edged, the bairn to avenge,<br>
      the sole-born son.—On his shoulder lay<br>
      braided breast-mail, barring death,<br>
      withstanding entrance of edge or blade.<br>
      Life would have ended for Ecgtheow’s son,<br>
      under wide earth for that earl of Geats,<br>
      had his armor of war not aided him,<br>
      battle-net hard, and holy God<br>
      wielded the victory, wisest Maker.<br>
      The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;<br>
      and easily rose the earl erect.
      </p>

      <h2>XXIII</h2>

      <p>
        ’MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,<br>
        old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,<br>
        warriors’ heirloom, weapon unmatched,<br>
        —save only ’twas more than other men<br>
        to bandy-of-battle could bear at all—<br>
        as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.<br>
        Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings’ chieftain,<br>
        bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,<br>
        reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote<br>
        that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,<br>
        her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through<br>
        that fated-one’s flesh: to floor she sank.<br>
        Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed.<br>
        Then blazed forth light. ’Twas bright within<br>
        as when from the sky there shines unclouded<br>
        heaven’s candle. The hall he scanned.<br>
        By the wall then went he; his weapon raised<br>
        high by its hilt the Hygelac-thane,<br>
        angry and eager. That edge was not useless<br>
        to the warrior now. He wished with speed<br>
        Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many,<br>
        for the war he waged on Western-Danes<br>
        oftener far than an only time,<br>
        when of Hrothgar’s hearth-companions<br>
        he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,<br>
        fifteen men of the folk of Danes,<br>
        and as many others outward bore,<br>
        his horrible prey. Well paid for that<br>
        the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw<br>
        Grendel stretched there, spent with war,<br>
        spoiled of life, so scathed had left him<br>
        Heorot’s battle. The body sprang far<br>
        when after death it endured the blow,<br>
        sword-stroke savage, that severed its head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon, then, saw the sage companions<br>
      who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,<br>
      that the tossing waters turbid grew,<br>
      blood-stained the mere. Old men together,<br>
      hoary-haired, of the hero spake;<br>
      the warrior would not, they weened, again,<br>
      proud of conquest, come to seek<br>
      their mighty master. To many it seemed<br>
      the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.<br>
      The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings<br>
      left the headland; homeward went<br>
      the gold-friend of men. But the guests sat on,<br>
      stared at the surges, sick in heart,<br>
      and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord<br>
      again to see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that sword began,<br>
from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,<br>
war-blade, to wane: ’twas a wondrous thing<br>
that all of it melted as ice is wont<br>
when frosty fetters the Father loosens,<br>
unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all<br>
seasons and times: the true God he!
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats<br>
      precious things, though a plenty he saw,<br>
      save only the head and that hilt withal<br>
      blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,<br>
      burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,<br>
      so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.<br>
      Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat<br>
      downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.<br>
      The clashing waters were cleanséd now,<br>
      waste of waves, where the wandering fiend<br>
      her life-days left and this lapsing world.<br>
      Swam then to strand the sailors’-refuge,<br>
      sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,<br>
      of burden brave he bore with him.<br>
      Went then to greet him, and God they thanked,<br>
      the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,<br>
      that safe and sound they could see him again.<br>
      Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor<br>
      deftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere,<br>
      water ’neath welkin, with war-blood stained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,<br>
      merry at heart the highways measured,<br>
      well-known roads. Courageous men<br>
      carried the head from the cliff by the sea,<br>
      an arduous task for all the band,<br>
      the firm in fight, since four were needed<br>
      on the shaft-of-slaughter strenuously<br>
      to bear to the gold-hall Grendel’s head.<br>
      So presently to the palace there<br>
      foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,<br>
      marching came. Their master-of-clan<br>
      mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.<br>
      Strode then within the sovran thane<br>
      fearless in fight, of fame renowned,<br>
      hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet.<br>
      And next by the hair into hall was borne<br>
      Grendel’s head, where the henchmen were drinking,<br>
      an awe to clan and queen alike,<br>
      a monster of marvel: the men looked on.
