        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita" target="_blank">The Bhagavad Gita</a>,
           often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is
           part of the epic <em>Mahabharata</em> (chapters 23–40 of Bhishma Parva).
           <em>The Gita</em> is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between
           Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Krishna. At the start
           of the Dharma Yudhha (righteous war) between Pandavas and Kauravas,
           Arjuna is filled with moral dilemma and despair about the violence
           and death the war will cause in the battle against his own kin.
           He wonders if he should renounce and seeks Krishna's counsel,
           whose answers and discourse constitute the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. Krishna
           counsels Arjuna to "fulfill his Kshatriya (warrior) duty to
           uphold the Dharma" through "selfless action".
           The Krishna–Arjuna dialogues cover a broad range of spiritual topics,
           touching upon ethical dilemmas and philosophical issues that go far
           beyond the war Arjuna faces. Krishna is also said as the first
           motivational speaker in human history. <em>The Bhagavad Gita</em> is the best
           known and most famous of Hindu texts, with a unique
           pan-Hindu influence. The Gita's call for selfless action inspired
           many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Bal
           Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi; the latter referred to it as
           his "spiritual dictionary".

      <h2>Chapter I</h2>

      <h3>DHRITIRASHTRA:</h3>

      <p>
        RANGED thus for battle on the sacred plain— <br>
        On <span class="tooltip">Kurukshetra<span class="tooltiptext">Kurukshetra is a city in the north Indian state of Haryana. It's known as the setting of the Hindu epic poem the "Mahabharata." West of the city, the town of Jyotisar is a pilgrimage site where, according to the "Mahabharata," the sacred "Bhagavad Gita" scripture was first delivered.</span></span>—say, Sanjaya! say<br>
        What wrought my people, and the <span class="tooltip">Pandavas<span class="tooltiptext">The Pandavas are the central characters of the longest Hindu epic Mahabharata who fought the Mahabharata War against their cousins Kauravas for the throne of Hastinapur in Kurukshetra.</span></span>?
      </p>

      <h3>SANJAYA:</h3>

      <p>
        When he beheld the host of Pandavas<br>
        Raja Duryôdhana to Drona drew,<br>
        And spake these words: “Ah, Guru! see this line,<br>
        How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,<br>
        Embattled by the son of Drupada,<br>
        Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked<br>
        Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhîma chiefs,<br>
        Benders of bows; Virâta, Yuyudhân,<br>
        Drupada, eminent upon his car,<br>
        Dhrishtaket, Chekitân, Kasi’s stout lord,<br>
        Purujit, Kuntibhôj, and Saivya,<br>
        With Yudhâmanyu, and Uttamauj<br>
        Subhadra’s child; and Drupadi’s;—all famed!<br>
        All mounted on their shining chariots!<br>
        On our side, too,—thou best of <span class="tooltip">Brahmans<span class="tooltiptext">a member of the highest Hindu caste, that of the priesthood.</span></span>! see<br>
        Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line,<br>
        Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,<br>
        Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,<br>
        Vikarna, Aswatthâman; next to these<br>
        Strong Saumadatti, with full many more<br>
        Valiant and tried, ready this day to die<br>
        For me their king, each with his weapon grasped,<br>
        Each skilful in the field. Weakest—meseems—<br>
        Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,<br>
        And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!<br>
        Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma’s ranks<br>
        Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, at the signal of the aged king,<br>
      With blare to wake the blood, rolling around<br>
      Like to a lion’s roar, the trumpeter<br>
      Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,<br>
      Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns<br>
      Burst into sudden clamor; as the blasts<br>
      Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!<br>
      Then might be seen, upon their car of gold<br>
      Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,<br>
      Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:<br>
      Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch<br>
      Carved of the “Gaint’s bone;” Arjuna blew<br>
      Indra’s loud gift; Bhima the terrible—<br>
      Wolf-bellied Bhima—blew a long reed-conch;<br>
      And Yudhisthira, Kunti’s blameless son,<br>
      Winded a mighty shell, “Victory’s Voice;”<br>
      And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch<br>
      Named the “Sweet-sounding,” Sahadev on his<br>
      Called “Gem-bedecked,” and Kasi’s Prince on his.<br>
      Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,<br>
      Virâta, Sâtyaki the Unsubdued,<br>
      Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)<br>
      Long-armed Subhadra’s children, all blew loud<br>
      So that the clangor shook their <span class="tooltip">foemen<span class="tooltiptext">foes, enemies, opposition</span></span>’s hearts,<br>
      With quaking earth and thundering heav’n.<br>
              Then ’twas—<br>
      Beholding Dhritirashtra’s battle set,<br>
      Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war<br>
      Instant to break—Arjun, whose ensign-badge<br>
      Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing<br>
      To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:<br>
      “Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground<br>
      Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh<br>
      These who will fight with us, those we must slay<br>
      To-day, in war’s arbitrament; for, sure,<br>
      On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,<br>
      Obeying Dhritirashtra’s sinful son.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, by Arjuna prayed (O Bharata!)<br>
      Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer<br>
      Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds<br>
      Where Bhishma led, and Drona, and their Lords.<br>
      “See!” spake he to Arjuna, “where they stand,<br>
      Thy kindred of the Kurus:” and the Prince<br>
      Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,<br>
      Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,<br>
      Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed<br>
      With friends and honored elders; some this side,<br>
      Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,<br>
      Such kith grown enemies—Arjuna’s heart<br>
      Melted with pity, while he uttered this:
      </p>

      <h3>ARJUNA:</h3>

      <p>
        Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed<br>
        Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin,<br>
        My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,<br>
        A shudder thrills my body, and my hair<br>
        Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips<br>
        Gandîv, the goodly bow; a fever burns<br>
        My skin to parching; hardly may I stand;<br>
        The life within me seems to swim and faint;<br>
        Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!<br>
        It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good<br>
        Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate<br>
        Triumph and domination, wealth and ease,<br>
        Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory<br>
        Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils<br>
        Could profit; what rule recompense; what span<br>
        Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?<br>
        Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,<br>
        For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,<br>
        And power grew precious:—grandsires, sires, and sons.<br>
        Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,<br>
        Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these<br>
        Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,<br>
        O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain<br>
        The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less<br>
        To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these<br>
        Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be<br>
        Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;<br>
        Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay<br>
        Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;<br>
        What peace could come of that, O Madhava?<br>
        For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,<br>
        These cannot see, or will not see, the sin<br>
        Of kingly lines o’erthrown and kinsmen slain,<br>
        How should not we, who see, shun such a crime—<br>
        We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame—<br>
        Oh, thou Delight of Men, Janârdana?<br>
        By overthrow of houses perisheth<br>
        Their sweet continuous household piety,<br>
        And—rites neglected, piety extinct—<br>
        Enters impiety upon that home;<br>
        Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring<br>
        Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,<br>
        Sending a Hell-ward road that family,<br>
        And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.<br>
        Nay, and the souls of honored ancestors<br>
        Fall from their place of peace, being bereft<br>
        Of funeral-cakes and the <span class="tooltip">wan<span class="tooltiptext">pale; weak</span></span> death-water.<br>
        So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay<br>
        Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,<br>
        Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!<br>
        Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,<br>
        To face them weaponless, and bare my breast<br>
        To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.
      </p>

      <p>
        So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,<br>
      Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,<br>
      And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.
      </p>
