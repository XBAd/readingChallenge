      <h2>Chapter I</h2>

      <h3>DHRITIRASHTRA:</h3>

      <p>
        RANGED thus for battle on the sacred plain— <br>
        On Kurukshetra—say, Sanjaya! say<br>
        What wrought my people, and the Pandavas?
      </p>

      <h3>SANJAYA:</h3>

      <p>
        When he beheld the host of Pandavas<br>
        Raja Duryôdhana to Drona drew,<br>
        And spake these words: “Ah, Guru! see this line,<br>
        How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men,<br>
        Embattled by the son of Drupada,<br>
        Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked<br>
        Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhîma chiefs,<br>
        Benders of bows; Virâta, Yuyudhân,<br>
        Drupada, eminent upon his car,<br>
        Dhrishtaket, Chekitân, Kasi’s stout lord,<br>
        Purujit, Kuntibhôj, and Saivya,<br>
        With Yudhâmanyu, and Uttamauj<br>
        Subhadra’s child; and Drupadi’s;—all famed!<br>
        All mounted on their shining chariots!<br>
        On our side, too,—thou best of Brahmans! see<br>
        Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line,<br>
        Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,<br>
        Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,<br>
        Vikarna, Aswatthâman; next to these<br>
        Strong Saumadatti, with full many more<br>
        Valiant and tried, ready this day to die<br>
        For me their king, each with his weapon grasped,<br>
        Each skilful in the field. Weakest—meseems—<br>
        Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,<br>
        And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!<br>
        Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma’s ranks<br>
        Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, at the signal of the aged king,<br>
      With blare to wake the blood, rolling around<br>
      Like to a lion’s roar, the trumpeter<br>
      Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,<br>
      Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns<br>
      Burst into sudden clamor; as the blasts<br>
      Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!<br>
      Then might be seen, upon their car of gold<br>
      Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,<br>
      Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:<br>
      Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch<br>
      Carved of the “Gaint’s bone;” Arjuna blew<br>
      Indra’s loud gift; Bhima the terrible—<br>
      Wolf-bellied Bhima—blew a long reed-conch;<br>
      And Yudhisthira, Kunti’s blameless son,<br>
      Winded a mighty shell, “Victory’s Voice;”<br>
      And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch<br>
      Named the “Sweet-sounding,” Sahadev on his<br>
      Called “Gem-bedecked,” and Kasi’s Prince on his.<br>
      Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,<br>
      Virâta, Sâtyaki the Unsubdued,<br>
      Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)<br>
      Long-armed Subhadra’s children, all blew loud<br>
      So that the clangor shook their foemen’s hearts,<br>
      With quaking earth and thundering heav’n.<br>
              Then ’twas—<br>
      Beholding Dhritirashtra’s battle set,<br>
      Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war<br>
      Instant to break—Arjun, whose ensign-badge<br>
      Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing<br>
      To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:<br>
      “Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground<br>
      Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh<br>
      These who will fight with us, those we must slay<br>
      To-day, in war’s arbitrament; for, sure,<br>
      On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,<br>
      Obeying Dhritirashtra’s sinful son.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, by Arjuna prayed (O Bharata!)<br>
      Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer<br>
      Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds<br>
      Where Bhishma led, and Drona, and their Lords.<br>
      “See!” spake he to Arjuna, “where they stand,<br>
      Thy kindred of the Kurus:” and the Prince<br>
      Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,<br>
      Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,<br>
      Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed<br>
      With friends and honored elders; some this side,<br>
      Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,<br>
      Such kith grown enemies—Arjuna’s heart<br>
      Melted with pity, while he uttered this:
      </p>

      <h3>ARJUNA:</h3>

      <p>
        Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed<br>
        Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin,<br>
        My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,<br>
        A shudder thrills my body, and my hair<br>
        Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips<br>
        Gandîv, the goodly bow; a fever burns<br>
        My skin to parching; hardly may I stand;<br>
        The life within me seems to swim and faint;<br>
        Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!<br>
        It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good<br>
        Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate<br>
        Triumph and domination, wealth and ease,<br>
        Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory<br>
        Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils<br>
        Could profit; what rule recompense; what span<br>
        Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?<br>
        Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,<br>
        For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,<br>
        And power grew precious:—grandsires, sires, and sons.<br>
        Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,<br>
        Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these<br>
        Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,<br>
        O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain<br>
        The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less<br>
        To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these<br>
        Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be<br>
        Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;<br>
        Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay<br>
        Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;<br>
        What peace could come of that, O Madhava?<br>
        For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,<br>
        These cannot see, or will not see, the sin<br>
        Of kingly lines o’erthrown and kinsmen slain,<br>
        How should not we, who see, shun such a crime—<br>
        We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame—<br>
        Oh, thou Delight of Men, Janârdana?<br>
        By overthrow of houses perisheth<br>
        Their sweet continuous household piety,<br>
        And—rites neglected, piety extinct—<br>
        Enters impiety upon that home;<br>
        Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring<br>
        Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,<br>
        Sending a Hell-ward road that family,<br>
        And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.<br>
        Nay, and the souls of honored ancestors<br>
        Fall from their place of peace, being bereft<br>
        Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.<br>
        So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay<br>
        Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,<br>
        Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!<br>
        Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,<br>
        To face them weaponless, and bare my breast<br>
        To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.
      </p>

      <p>
        So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,<br>
      Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,<br>
      And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.
      </p>

        “Arjun-Vishâd,” or “The Book of the<br>
        Distress of Arjuna.”
