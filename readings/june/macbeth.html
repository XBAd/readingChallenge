      <h2>Act III</h2>

      <h2>Scene IV</h2>

      <h3>[The same. Hall in the palace]</h3>

      <em>A banquet prepar’d. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants</em>

      <p>
        <em>Macb.</em>  You know your own degrees; sit down. At first <br>
      And last, the hearty welcome.<br>
        <em>Lords.</em>        Thanks to your Majesty.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Ourself will mingle with society<br>
      And play the humble host.<br>
      Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time<br>
      We will require her welcome.<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>  Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,<br>
      For my heart speaks they are welcome.
      </p>

      <em>First Murderer [appears at the door]</em>

      <p>
        <em>Macb.</em>  See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.<br>
      Both sides are even; here I’ll sit i’ the midst.<br>
      Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure<br>
      The table round.  [Approaching the door.]<br>
              —There’s blood upon thy face.<br>
        <em>Mur.</em>  ’Tis Banquo’s then.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  ’Tis better thee without than he within.<br>
      Is he dispatch’d?<br>
        <em>Mur.</em>  My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Thou art the best o’ the cut-throats; yet he’s good<br>
      That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it,<br>
      Thou art the nonpareil.<br>
        <em>Mur.</em>        Most royal sir,<br>
      Fleance is scap’d.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,<br>
      Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,<br>
      As broad and general as the casing air;<br>
      But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in<br>
      To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?<br>
        <em>Mur.</em>  Ay, my good lord; safe in a ditch he bides,<br>
      With twenty trenched gashes on his head,<br>
      The least a death to nature.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>        Thanks for that;<br>
      There the grown serpent lies. The worm that’s fled<br>
      Hath nature that in time will venom breed,<br>
      No teeth for the present. Get thee gone; to-morrow<br>
      We’ll hear ourselves again. Exit Murderer.<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>        My royal lord,<br>
      You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold<br>
      That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,<br>
      ’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;<br>
      From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;<br>
      Meeting were bare without it.
      </p>

      <em>Enter the Ghost of BANQUO, and sits in MACBETH’S place</em>

      <p>
        <em>Macb.</em>        Sweet remembrancer!<br>
      Now, good digestion wait on appetite,<br>
      And health on both!<br>
        <em>Len.</em>        May ’t please your Highness sit.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Here had we now our country’s honour roof’d,<br>
      Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present,<br>
      Who may I rather challenge for unkindness<br>
      Than pity for mischance.<br>
        <em>Ross.</em>        His absence, sir,<br>
      Lays blame upon his promise. Please ’t your Highness<br>
      To grace us with your royal company?<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  The table’s full.<br>
        <em>Len.</em>        Here is a place reserv’d, sir.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Where?<br>
        <em>Len.</em>  Here, my good lord. What is ’t that moves your Highness?<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Which of you have done this?<br>
        <em>Lords.</em>        What, my good lord?<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Thou canst not say I did it; never shake<br>
      Thy gory locks at me.<br>
        <em>Ross.</em>  Gentlemen, rise: his Highness is not well.<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>  Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,<br>
      And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat;<br>
      The fit is momentary; upon a thought<br>
      He will again be well. If much you note him,<br>
      You shall offend him and extend his passion.<br>
      Feed, and regard him not. [Aside to MACBETH.]<br>
      Are you a man?<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that<br>
      Which might appall the devil.<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>  [Aside to MACBETH.]  O proper stuff!<br>
      This is the very painting of your fear;<br>
      This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,<br>
      Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,<br>
      Impostors to true fear, would well become<br>
      A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,<br>
      Authoriz’d by her grandam. Shame itself!<br>
      Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,<br>
      You look but on a stool.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you?<br>
      Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.<br>
      If charnel-houses and our graves must send<br>
      Those that we bury back, our monuments<br>
      Shall be the maws of kites.  [Ghost vanishes.]<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>  [Aside to MACBETH.]  What, quite unmann’d in folly?<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  If I stand here, I saw him.<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>  [Aside to MACBETH.]  Fie, for shame!<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>  Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ the olden time,<br>
      Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;<br>
      Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d<br>
      Too terrible for the ear. The time has been,<br>
      That, when the brains were out, the man would die,<br>
      And there an end; but now they rise again,<br>
      With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,<br>
      And push us from our stools. This is more strange<br>
      Than such a murder is.<br>
        <em>Lady M.</em>        My worthy lord,<br>
      Your noble friends do lack you.<br>
        <em>Macb.</em>        I do forget.<br>
      Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends;<br>
      I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing<br>
      To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;<br>
      Then I’ll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
      </p>

      <em>Re-enter Ghost</em>

      <p>
        I drink to the general joy o’ the whole table,<br>
        And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;<br>
        Would he were here! to all and him we thirst,<br>
        And all to all.<br>
          <em>Lords.</em>        Our duties, and the pledge.<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>  Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!<br>
        Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;<br>
        Thou hast no speculation in those eyes<br>
        Which thou dost glare with!<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>        Think of this, good peers,<br>
        But as a thing of custom; ’tis no other,<br>
        Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>  What man dare, I dare.<br>
        Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,<br>
        The arm’d rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;<br>
        Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves<br>
        Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,<br>
        And dare me to the desert with thy sword;<br>
        If trembling I inhabit then, protest me<br>
        The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!<br>
        Unreal mockery, hence!  [Ghost vanishes.]<br>
                Why, so; being gone,<br>
        I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>  You have displac’d the mirth, broke the good meeting,<br>
        With most admir’d disorder.<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>        Can such things be,<br>
        And overcome us like a summer’s cloud,<br>
        Without our special wonder? You make me strange<br>
        Even to the disposition that I owe,<br>
        When now I think you can behold such sights,<br>
        And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,<br>
        When mine is blanch’d with fear.<br>
          <em>Ross.</em>        What sights, my lord?<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>  I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;<br>
        Question enrages him. At once, good-night.<br>
        Stand not upon the order of your going,<br>
        But go at once.<br>
          <em>Len.</em>        Good-night; and better health<br>
        Attend his Majesty!<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>        A kind good-night to all! Exeunt Lords.<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>  It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.<br>
        Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;<br>
        Augures and understood relations have<br>
        By maggot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth<br>
        The secret’st man of blood. What is the night?<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>  Almost at odds with morning, which is which.<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>  How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person<br>
        At our great bidding?<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>        Did you send to him, sir?<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>  I hear it by the way; but I will send.<br>
        There’s not a one of them but in his house<br>
        I keep a servant fee’d. I will to-morrow,<br>
        And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.<br>
        More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,<br>
        By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good<br>
        All causes shall give way. I am in blood<br>
        Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,<br>
        Returning were as tedious as go o’er.<br>
        Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,<br>
        Which must be acted ere they may be scann’d.<br>
          <em>Lady M.</em>  You lack the season of all natures, sleep.<br>
          <em>Macb.</em>  Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse<br>
        Is the initiate fear that wants hard use;<br>
        We are yet but young in deed.  Exeunt.

      <h3>[A heath]</h3>

      <em>Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting HECATE</em>

      <p>
        <em>1. Witch.</em>  Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.<br>
        <em>Hec.</em> Have I not reason, beldams as you are,<br>
      Saucy and overbold? How did you dare<br>
      To trade and traffic with Macbeth<br>
      In riddles and affairs of death;<br>
      And I, the mistress of your charms,<br>
      The close contriver of all harms,<br>
      Was never call’d to bear my part,<br>
      Or show the glory of our art?<br>
      And, which is worse, all you have done<br>
      Hath been but for a wayward son,<br>
      Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,<br>
      Loves for his own ends, not for you.<br>
      But make amends now; get you gone,<br>
      And at the pit of Acheron<br>
      Meet me i’ the morning; thither he<br>
      Will come to know his destiny.<br>
      Your vessels and your spells provide,<br>
      Your charms and everything beside.<br>
      I am for the air; this night I’ll spend<br>
      Unto a dismal and a fatal end;<br>
      Great business must be wrought ere noon.<br>
      Upon the corner of the moon<br>
      There hangs a vaporous drop profound;<br>
      I’ll catch it ere it come to ground;<br>
      And that distill’d by magic sleights<br>
      Shall raise such artificial sprites<br>
      As by the strength of their illusion<br>
      Shall draw him on to his confusion.<br>
      He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear<br>
      His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear;<br>
      And, you all know, security<br>
      Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.  Music, and a song<br>
      Hark! I am call’d; my little spirit, see,<br>
      Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.  [Exit.]  (Sing within: “Come away, come away,” etc.)<br>
        <em>1. Witch.</em>  Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.  Exeunt.
      </p>

      <h2>Act III</h2>

      <h2>Scene VI</h2>

      <h3>[Forres. The palace]</h3>

      <em>Enter LENNOX and another Lord</em>

      <p>
        <em>Len.</em>  My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,<br>
      Which can interpret farther; only, I say,<br>
      Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan<br>
      Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead:<br>
      And the right-valiant Banquo walk’d too late;<br>
      Whom, you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance kill’d,<br>
      For Fleance fled; men must not walk too late.<br>
      Who cannot want the thought how monstrous<br>
      It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain<br>
      To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!<br>
      How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight<br>
      In pious rage the two delinquents tear,<br>
      That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<br>
      Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;<br>
      For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive<br>
      To hear the men deny ’t. So that, I say,<br>
      He has borne all things well; and I do think<br>
      That had he Duncan’s sons under his key—<br>
      As, an ’t please Heaven, he shall not—they should find<br>
      What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<br>
      But, peace! for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d<br>
      His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear<br>
      Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell<br>
      Where he bestows himself?<br>
        <em>Lord.</em>        The son of Duncan,<br>
      From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,<br>
      Lives in the English court, and is receiv’d<br>
      Of the most pious Edward with such grace<br>
      That the malevolence of Fortune nothing<br>
      Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff<br>
      Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<br>
      To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;<br>
      That, by the help of these—with Him above<br>
      To ratify the work—we may again<br>
      Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,<br>
      Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,<br>
      Do faithful homage and receive free honours;<br>
      All which we pine for now: and this report<br>
      Hath so exasperate their king that he<br>
      Prepares for some attempt of war.<br>
        <em>Len.</em>        Sent he to Macduff?<br>
        <em>Lord.</em>  He did; and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”<br>
      The cloudy messenger turns me his back,<br>
      And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time<br>
      That clogs me with this answer.”<br>
        <em>Len.</em>        And that well might<br>
      Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance<br>
      His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel<br>
      Fly to the court of England and unfold<br>
      His message ere he come, that a swift blessing<br>
      May soon return to this our suffering country<br>
      Under a hand accurs’d!<br>
        <em>Lord.</em>        I’ll send my prayers with him.  Exeunt.
