      <p>
        YE learnèd sisters, which have oftentimes <br>
  Beene to me ayding, others to adorne,<br>
  Whom ye thought worthy of your gracefull rymes,<br>
  That even the greatest did not greatly scorne<br>
  To heare theyr names sung in your simple layes,<br>
  But joyed in theyr praise;<br>
  And when ye list your owne mishaps to mourne,<br>
  Which death, or love, or fortunes wreck did rayse,<br>
  Your string could soone to sadder tenor turne,<br>
  And teach the woods and waters to lament<br>
  Your doleful dreriment:<br>
  Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside;<br>
  And, having all your heads with girlands crownd,<br>
  Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound;<br>
  Ne let the same of any be envide:<br>
  So Orpheus did for his owne bride!<br>
  So I unto my selfe alone will sing;<br>
  The woods shall to me answer, and my Eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early, before the worlds light-giving lampe<br>
        His golden beame upon the hils doth spred,<br>
        Having disperst the nights unchearefull dampe,<br>
        Doe ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-hed,<br>
        Go to the bowre of my belovèd love,<br>
        My truest turtle dove;<br>
        Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,<br>
        And long since ready forth his maske to move,<br>
        With his bright Tead that flames with many a flake,<br>
        And many a bachelor to waite on him,<br>
        In theyr fresh garments trim.<br>
        Bid her awake therefore, and soone her dight,<br>
        For lo! the wishèd day is come at last,<br>
        That shall, for all the paynes and sorrowes past,<br>
        Pay to her usury of long delight:<br>
        And, whylest she doth her dight,<br>
        Doe ye to her of joy and solace sing,<br>
        That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bring with you all the Nymphes that you can heare<br>
        Both of the rivers and the forrests greene,<br>
        And of the sea that neighbours to her neare:<br>
        Al with gay girlands goodly wel beseene.<br>
        And let them also with them bring in hand<br>
        Another gay girland<br>
        For my fayre love, of lillyes and of roses,<br>
        Bound truelove wize, with a blew silke riband.<br>
        And let them make great store of bridale poses,<br>
        And let them eeke bring store of other flowers,<br>
        To deck the bridale bowers.<br>
        And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,<br>
        For feare the stones her tender foot should wrong,<br>
        Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,<br>
        And diapred lyke the discolored mead.<br>
        Which done, doe at her chamber dore awayt,<br>
        For she will waken strayt;<br>
        The whiles doe ye this song unto her sing,<br>
        The woods shall to you answer, and your Eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ye Nymphes of Mulla, which with carefull heed<br>
        The silver scaly trouts doe tend full well,<br>
        And greedy pikes which use therein to feed:<br>
        (Those trouts and pikes all others doo excell;)<br>
        And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake,<br>
        Where none doo fishes take;<br>
        Bynd up the locks the which hang scattered light,<br>
        And in his waters, which your mirror make,<br>
        Behold your faces as the christall bright,<br>
        That when you come whereas my love doth lie,<br>
        No blemish she may spie.<br>
        And eke, ye lightfoot mayds, which keep the deere,<br>
        That on the hoary mountayne used to towre;<br>
        And the wylde wolves, which seeke them to devoure,<br>
        With your steel darts doo chace from coming neer,<br>
        Be also present heere,<br>
        To helpe to decke her, and to help to sing,<br>
        That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time;<br>
        The Rosy Morne long since left Tithones bed,<br>
        All ready to her silver coche to clyme;<br>
        And Phœbus gins to shew his glorious hed.<br>
        Hark! how the cheereful birds do chaunt theyr laies<br>
        And carrol of Loves praise.<br>
        The merry Larke hir mattins sings aloft;<br>
        The Thrush replyes; the Mavis descant playes;<br>
        The Ouzell shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;<br>
        So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,<br>
        To this dayes merriment.<br>
        Ah! my deere love, why doe ye sleepe thus long?<br>
        When meeter were that ye should now awake,<br>
        T’ awayt the comming of your joyous make,<br>
        And hearken to the birds love-learnèd song,<br>
        The deawy leaves among!<br>
        For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,<br>
        That all the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        My love is now awake out of her dreames,<br>
        And her fayre eyes, like stars that dimmèd were<br>
        With darksome cloud, now shew theyr goodly beams<br>
        More bright then Hesperus his head doth rere.<br>
        Come now, ye damzels, daughters of delight,<br>
        Helpe quickly her to dight:<br>
        But first come ye fayre houres, which were begot<br>
        In Joves sweet paradice of Day and Night;<br>
        Which doe the seasons of the yeare allot,<br>
        And al, that ever in this world is fayre,<br>
        Doe make and still repayre:<br>
        And ye three handmayds of the Cyprian Queene,<br>
        The which doe still adorne her beauties pride,<br>
        Helpe to addorne my beautifullest bride:<br>
        And, as ye her array, still throw betweene<br>
        Some graces to be seene;<br>
        And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,<br>
        The whiles the woods shal answer, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now is my love all ready forth to come:<br>
        Let all the virgins therefore well awayt:<br>
        And ye fresh boyes, that tend upon her groome,<br>
        Prepare yourselves; for he is comming strayt.<br>
        Set all your things in seemely good array,<br>
        Fit for so joyfull day:<br>
        The joyfulst day that ever sunne did see.<br>
        Faire Sun! shew forth thy favourable ray,<br>
        And let thy lifull heat not fervent be,<br>
        For feare of burning her sunshyny face,<br>
        Her beauty to disgrace.<br>
        O fayrest Phœbus! father of the Muse!<br>
        If ever I did honour thee aright,<br>
        Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,<br>
        Doe not thy servants simple boone refuse;<br>
        But let this day, let this one day, be myne;<br>
        Let all the rest be thine.<br>
        Then I thy soverayne prayses loud wil sing,<br>
        That all the woods shal answer, and theyr eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Harke! how the Minstrils gin to shrill aloud<br>
        Their merry Musick that resounds from far,<br>
        The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling Croud,<br>
        That well agree withouten breach or jar.<br>
        But, most of all, the Damzels doe delite<br>
        When they their tymbrels smyte,<br>
        And thereunto doe daunce and carrol sweet,<br>
        That all the sences they doe ravish quite;<br>
        The whyles the boyes run up and downe the street,<br>
        Crying aloud with strong confusèd noyce,<br>
        As if it were one voyce,<br>
        Hymen, iö Hymen, Hymen, they do shout;<br>
        That even to the heavens theyr shouting shrill<br>
        Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;<br>
        To which the people standing all about,<br>
        As in approvance, doe thereto applaud,<br>
        And loud advaunce her laud;<br>
        And evermore they Hymen, Hymen sing,<br>
        That al the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loe! where she comes along with portly pace,<br>
        Lyke Phoebe, from her chamber of the East,<br>
        Arysing forth to run her mighty race,<br>
        Clad all in white, that seemes a virgin best.<br>
        So well it her beseemes, that ye would weene<br>
        Some angell she had beene.<br>
        Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,<br>
        Sprinckled with perle, and perling flowres atweene,<br>
        Doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre;<br>
        And, being crownèd with a girland greene,<br>
        Seeme lyke some mayden Queene.<br>
        Her modest eyes, abashèd to behold<br>
        So many gazers as on her do stare,<br>
        Upon the lowly ground affixèd are;<br>
        Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,<br>
        But blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,<br>
        So farre from being proud.<br>
        Nathless doe ye still loud her prayses sing,<br>
        That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tell me, ye merchants daughters, did ye see<br>
        So fayre a creature in your towne before;<br>
        So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,<br>
        Adorned with beautyes grace and vertues store?<br>
        Her goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining bright,<br>
        Her forehead yvory white,<br>
        Her cheeks lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,<br>
        Her lips like cherryes charming men to byte,<br>
        Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,<br>
        Her paps lyke lyllies budded,<br>
        Her snowie neck lyke to a marble towre;<br>
        And all her body like a pallace fayre,<br>
        Ascending up, with many a stately stayre,<br>
        To honours seat and chastities sweet bowre.<br>
        Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,<br>
        Upon her so to gaze,<br>
        Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,<br>
        To which the woods did answer, and your eccho ring?
      </p>

      <p>
        But if ye was that which no eyes can see,<br>
        The inward beauty of her lively spright,<br>
        Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree,<br>
        Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,<br>
        And stand astonisht lyke to those which red<br>
        Medusaes mazeful hed.<br>
        There dwels sweet love, and constant chastity,<br>
        Unspotted fayth, and comely womanhood,<br>
        Regard of honour, and mild modesty;<br>
        There vertue raynes as Queene in royal throne,<br>
        And giveth lawes alone,<br>
        The which the base affections doe obay,<br>
        And yeeld theyr services unto her will;<br>
        Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may<br>
        Thereto approch to tempt her mind to ill.<br>
        Had ye once seene these her celestial threasures,<br>
        And unrevealèd pleasures,<br>
        Then would ye wonder, and her prayses sing,<br>
        That al the woods should answer, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open the temple gates unto my love,<br>
        Open them wide that she may enter in,<br>
        And all the postes adorne as doth behove,<br>
        And all the pillours deck with girlands trim,<br>
        For to receyve this Saynt with honour dew,<br>
        That commeth in to you.<br>
        With trembling steps, and humble reverence,<br>
        She commeth in, before th’ Almighties view;<br>
        Of her ye virgins learne obedience,<br>
        When so ye come into those holy places,<br>
        To humble your proud faces:<br>
        Bring her up to th’ high altar, that she may<br>
        The sacred ceremonies there partake,<br>
        The which do endlesse matrimony make;<br>
        And let the roring Organs loudly play<br>
        The praises of the Lord in lively notes;<br>
        The whiles, with hollow throates,<br>
        The Choristers the joyous Antheme sing,<br>
        That al the woods may answere, and their eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,<br>
        Hearing the holy priest that to her speakes,<br>
        And blesseth her with his two happy hands,<br>
        How the red roses flush up in her cheekes,<br>
        And the pure snow, with goodly vermill stayne<br>
        Like crimsin dyde in grayne:<br>
        That even th’ Angels, which continually<br>
        About the sacred Altare doe remaine,<br>
        Forget their service and about her fly,<br>
        Ofte peeping in her face, that seems more fayre,<br>
        The more they on it stare.<br>
        But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,<br>
        Are governèd with goodly modesty,<br>
        That suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,<br>
        Which may let in one little thought unsownd.<br>
        Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,<br>
        The pledge of all our band!<br>
        Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluya sing,<br>
        That all the woods may answere, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now al is done: bring home the bride againe;<br>
        Bring home the triumph of our victory:<br>
        Bring home with you the glory of her gaine<br>
        With joyance bring her and with jollity.<br>
        Never had man more joyfull day then this,<br>
        Whom heaven would heape with blis,<br>
        Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;<br>
        This day for ever to me holy is.<br>
        Poure out the wine without restraint or stay,<br>
        Poure not by cups, but by the belly full,<br>
        Poure out to all that wull,<br>
        And sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,<br>
        That they may sweat, and drunken be withall.<br>
        Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,<br>
        And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine;<br>
        And let the Graces daunce unto the rest,<br>
        For they can doo it best:<br>
        The whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,<br>
        To which the woods shall answer, and theyr eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ring ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,<br>
        And leave your wonted labors for this day:<br>
        This day is holy; doe ye write it downe,<br>
        That ye for ever it remember may.<br>
        This day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,<br>
        With Barnaby the bright,<br>
        From whence declining daily by degrees,<br>
        He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,<br>
        When once the Crab behind his back he sees.<br>
        But for this time it ill ordainèd was,<br>
        To chose the longest day in all the yeare,<br>
        The shortest night, when longest fitter weare:<br>
        Yet never day so long, but late would passe.<br>
        Ring ye the bels, to make it weare away,<br>
        And bonefiers make all day;<br>
        And daunce about them, and about them sing,<br>
        That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah! when will this long weary day have end,<br>
        And lende me leave to come unto my love?<br>
        How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?<br>
        How slowly does sad Time his feathers move?<br>
        Hast thee, O fayrest Planet, to thy home,<br>
        Within the Westerne fome:<br>
        Thy tyrèd steedes long since have need of rest.<br>
        Long though it be, at last I see it gloome,<br>
        And the bright evening-star with golden creast<br>
        Appeare out of the East.<br>
        Fayre childe of beauty! glorious lampe of love!<br>
        That all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,<br>
        And guydest lovers through the nights sad dread,<br>
        How chearefully thou lookest from above,<br>
        And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light,<br>
        As joying in the sight<br>
        Of these glad many, which for joy doe sing,<br>
        That all the woods them answer, and their eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now ceasse, ye damsels, your delights fore-past;<br>
        Enough it is that all the day was youres:<br>
        Now day is doen, and night is nighing fast,<br>
        Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.<br>
        The night is come, now soon her disaray,<br>
        And in her bed her lay;<br>
        Lay her in lillies and in violets,<br>
        And silken courteins over her display,<br>
        And odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets,<br>
        Behold how goodly my faire love does ly,<br>
        In proud humility!<br>
        Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took<br>
        In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,<br>
        Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,<br>
        With bathing in the Acidalian brooke.<br>
        Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon,<br>
        And leave my love alone,<br>
        And leave likewise your former lay to sing:<br>
        The woods no more shall answere, nor your eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,<br>
        That long daies labour doest at last defray,<br>
        And all my cares, which cruell Love collected,<br>
        Hast sumd in one, and cancellèd for aye:<br>
        Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,<br>
        That no man may us see;<br>
        And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,<br>
        From feare of perrill and foule horror free.<br>
        Let no false treason seeke us to entrap,<br>
        Nor any dread disquiet once annoy<br>
        The safety of our joy;<br>
        But let the night be calme, and quietsome,<br>
        Without tempestuous storms or sad afray:<br>
        Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,<br>
        When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:<br>
        Or lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie<br>
        And begot Majesty.<br>
        And let the mayds and yong men cease to sing;<br>
        Ne let the woods them answer nor theyr eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares<br>
        Be heard all night within, nor yet without:<br>
        Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,<br>
        Breake gentle sleepe with misconceivèd dout.<br>
        Let no deluding dreames, nor dreadfull sights,<br>
        Make sudden sad affrights;<br>
        Ne let house-fyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,<br>
        Ne let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,<br>
        Ne let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,<br>
        Ne let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,<br>
        Fray us with things that be not;<br>
        Let not the shriech Oule nor the Storke be heard,<br>
        Nor the night Raven, that still deadly yels:<br>
        Nor dammèd ghosts, cald up with mighty spels,<br>
        Nor griesly vultures, make us once affeard:<br>
        Ne let th’ unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking<br>
        Make us to wish theyr choking.<br>
        Let none of these theyr drery accents sing;<br>
        Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.
      </p>

        But still let Silence trew night-watches keepe,<br>
        That sacred Peace may in assurance rayne,<br>
        And tymely Sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,<br>
        May poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne;<br>
        The whiles an hundred little wingèd loves,<br>
        Like divers-fethered doves,<br>
        Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,<br>
        And in the secret darke, that none reproves,<br>
        Their prety stealthes shal worke, and snares shal spread<br>
        To filch away sweet snatches of delight,<br>
        Conceald through covert night.<br>
        Ye sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will!<br>
        For greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,<br>
        Thinks more upon her paradise of joyes,<br>
        Then what ye do, albe it good or ill.<br>
        All night therefore attend your merry play,<br>
        For it will soone be day:<br>
        Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing;<br>
        Ne will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.

        Who is the same, which at my window peepes?<br>
        Or whose is that faire face that shines so bright?<br>
        Is it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,<br>
        But walkes about high heaven al the night?<br>
        O! fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy<br>
        My love with me to spy:<br>
        For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought<br>
        And for a fleece of wooll, which privily<br>
        The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought,<br>
        His pleasures with thee wrought.<br>
        Therefore to us be favourable now;<br>
        And sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,<br>
        And generation goodly dost enlarge,<br>
        Encline thy will t’effect our wishfull vow,<br>
        And the chaste wombe informe with timely seed,<br>
        That may our comfort breed:<br>
        Till which we cease our hopefull hap to sing;<br>
        Ne let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        And thou, great Juno! which with awful might<br>
        The lawes of wedlock still dost patronize;<br>
        And the religion of the faith first plight<br>
        With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize;<br>
        And eeke for comfort often callèd art<br>
        Of women in their smart;<br>
        Eternally bind thou this lovely band,<br>
        And all thy blessings unto us impart.<br>
        And thou, glad Genius! in whose gentle hand<br>
        The bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,<br>
        Without blemish or staine;<br>
        And the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight<br>
        With secret ayde doest succor and supply,<br>
        Till they bring forth the fruitfull progeny;<br>
        Send us the timely fruit of this same night.<br>
        And thou, fayre Hebe! and thou, Hymen free!<br>
        Grant that it may so be.<br>
        Till which we cease your further prayse to sing;<br>
        Ne any woods shall answer, nor your Eccho ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,<br>
        In which a thousand torches flaming bright<br>
        Doe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods<br>
        In dreadful darknesse lend desirèd light;<br>
        And all ye powers which in the same remayne,<br>
        More then we men can fayne!<br>
        Poure out your blessing on us plentiously,<br>
        And happy influence upon us raine,<br>
        That we may raise a large posterity,<br>
        Which from the earth, which they may long possesse<br>
        With lasting happinesse,<br>
        Up to your haughty pallaces may mount;<br>
        And for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit,<br>
        May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,<br>
        Of blessèd Saints for to increase the count.<br>
        So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,<br>
        And cease till then our tymely joyes to sing:<br>
        The woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring!
      </p>

      <p>
        Song! made in lieu of many ornaments,<br>
        With which my love should duly have been dect,<br>
        Which cutting off through hasty accidents,<br>
        Ye would not stay your dew time to expect,<br>
        But promist both to recompens;<br>
        Be unto her a goodly ornament,<br>
        And for short time an endlesse moniment.
