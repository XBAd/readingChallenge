        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred" target="_blank">Manfred</a>
           is a closet drama written in 1816–1817 by Lord Byron. It contains
           supernatural elements, in keeping with the popularity of the ghost
           story in England at the time. It is a typical example of a Gothic fiction.
           Byron commenced this work in late 1816, only a few months after the
           famous ghost-story sessions with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley
           that provided the initial impetus for <em>Frankenstein</em>. The supernatural
           references are made clear throughout the poem. Manfred was adapted
           musically by Robert Schumann in 1852, in a composition
           entitled <em>Manfred: Dramatic Poem with Music in Three Parts</em>,
           and later by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his <em>Manfred Symphony</em>.
           Friedrich Nietzsche was inspired by the poem's depiction of a
           super-human being to compose a piano score in 1872 based on it,
           "Manfred Meditation".

      <h2>Act I</h2>
      <h2>Scene II</h2>

      <p>
        The Mountain of the <span class="tooltip">Jungfrau<span class="tooltiptext">The Jungfrau, at 4,158 meters is one of the main summits of the Bernese Alps</span></span>.—Time, Morning. MANFRED alone upon the Cliffs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  The spirits I have raised abandon me, <br>
      The spells which I have studied baffle me,<br>
      The remedy I reck’d of tortured me;<br>
      I lean no more on superhuman aid,<br>
      It hath no power upon the past, and for<br>
      The future, till the past be gulf’d in darkness,<br>
      It is not of my search.—My mother Earth!<br>
      And thou fresh breaking Day, and you, ye Mountains,<br>
      Why are ye beautiful? I cannot love ye.<br>
      And thou, the bright eye of the universe,<br>
      That openest over all, and unto all<br>
      Art a delight—thou shin’st not on my heart.<br>
      And you, ye crags, upon whose extreme edge<br>
      I stand, and on the torrent’s brink beneath<br>
      Behold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs<br>
      In dizziness of distance; when a leap,<br>
      A stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring<br>
      My breast upon its rocky bosom’s bed<br>
      To rest for ever—wherefore do I pause?<br>
      I feel the impulse—yet I do not plunge;<br>
      I see the peril—yet do not recede;<br>
      And my brain reels—and yet my foot is firm.<br>
      There is a power upon me which withholds,<br>
      And makes it my fatality to live;<br>
      If it be life to wear within myself<br>
      This barrenness of spirit, and to be<br>
      My own soul’s <span class="tooltip">sepulchre<span class="tooltiptext">tomb; a small room or monument, cut in rock or built of stone, in which a dead person is laid or buried.</span></span>, for I have ceased<br>
      To justify my deeds unto myself—<br>
      The last infirmity of evil. Ay,<br>
      Thou winged and cloud—cleaving minister,  [An eagle passes.]<br>
      Whose happy flight is highest into heaven,<br>
      Well may’st thou swoop so near me—I should be<br>
      Thy prey, and gorge thine eaglets; thou art gone<br>
      Where the eye cannot follow thee; but thine<br>
      Yet pierces downward, onward, or above,<br>
      With a pervading vision.—Beautiful!<br>
      How beautiful is all this visible world!<br>
      How glorious in its action and itself!<br>
      But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,<br>
      Half dust, half deity, alike unfit<br>
      To sink or soar, with our mix’d essence make<br>
      A conflict of its elements, and breathe<br>
      The breath of degradation and of pride,<br>
      Contending with low wants and lofty will,<br>
      Till our mortality predominates,<br>
      And men are—what they name not to themselves,<br>
      And trust not to each other. Hark! the note,  [The Shepherd’s pipe in the distance is heard.]<br>
      The natural music of the mountain reed<br>
      (For here the patriarchal days are not<br>
      A pastoral fable) pipes in the liberal air,<br>
      Mix’d with the sweet bells of the sauntering herd;<br>
      My soul would drink those echoes.—Oh, that I were<br>
      The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,<br>
      A living voice, a breathing harmony,<br>
      A bodiless enjoyment—born and dying<br>
      With the blest tone which made me!
      </p>

      <h3>
        Enter from below a CHAMOIS HUNTER
      </h3>

      <p>
        <em>Chamois Hunter.</em>                Even so<br>
      This way the <span class="tooltip">chamois<span class="tooltiptext">
an agile goat-antelope with short hooked horns, found in mountainous areas of Europe from Spain to the Caucasus.</span></span> leapt: her nimble feet<br>
      Have baffled me; my gains to—day will scarce<br>
      Repay my break—neck travail.—What is here?<br>
      Who seems not of my trade, and yet hath reach’d<br>
      A height which none even of our mountaineers,<br>
      Save our best hunters, may attain: his garb<br>
      Is goodly, his <span class="tooltip">mien<span class="tooltiptext">a person's look or manner, especially one of a particular kind indicating their character or mood.</span></span> manly, and his air<br>
      Proud as a freeborn peasant’s, at this distance—<br>
      I will approach him nearer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  (not perceiving the other). To be thus—<br>
      Grey—hair’d with anguish, like these blasted pines.<br>
      Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless,<br>
      A blighted trunk upon a cursed root,<br>
      Which but supplies a feeling to decay—<br>
      And to be thus, eternally but thus,<br>
      Having been otherwise! Now furrow’d o’er<br>
      With wrinkles, plough’d by moments, not by years<br>
      And hours—all tortured into ages—hours<br>
      Which I outlive!—Ye toppling crags of ice!<br>
      Ye avalanches, whom a breath draws down<br>
      In mountainous o’erwhelming, come and crush me!<br>
      I hear ye momently above, beneath,<br>
      Crash with a frequent conflict; but ye pass,<br>
      And only fall on things that still would live;<br>
      On the young flourishing forest, or the hut<br>
      And hamlet of the harmless villager.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  The mists begin to rise from up the valley;<br>
      I’ll warn him to descend, or he may chance<br>
      To lose at once his way and life together.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds<br>
      Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,<br>
      Like foam from the roused ocean of deep Hell,<br>
      Whose every wave breaks on a living shore<br>
      Heap’d with the damn’d like pebbles.—I am giddy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  I must approach him cautiously; if near,<br>
      A sudden step will startle him, and he<br>
      Seems tottering already.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>                Mountains have fallen,<br>
      Leaving a gap in the clouds, and with the shock<br>
      Rocking their Alpine brethren; filling up<br>
      The ripe green valleys with destruction’s splinters;<br>
      Damming the rivers with a sudden dash,<br>
      Which crush’d the waters into mist and made<br>
      Their fountains find another channel—thus,<br>
      Thus, in its old age, did Mount Rosenberg—<br>
      Why stood I not beneath it?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>                Friend! have a care,<br>
      Your next step may be fatal!—for the love<br>
      Of him who made you, stand not on that brink!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  (not hearing him). Such would have been for me a fitting tomb;<br>
      My bones had then been quiet in their depth;<br>
      They had not then been strewn upon the rocks<br>
      For the wind’s pastime—as thus—thus they shall be—<br>
      In this one plunge.—Farewell, ye opening heavens!<br>
      Look not upon me thus reproachfully—<br>
      Ye were not meant for me—Earth! take these atoms!   [As MANFRED is in act to spring from the cliff, the CHAMOIS HUNTER seizes and retains him with a sudden grasp.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  Hold, madman!—though aweary of thy life,<br>
      Stain not our pure <span class="tooltip">vales<span class="tooltiptext">a valley (used in place names or as a poetic term).</span></span> with thy guilty blood!<br>
      Away with me—I will not quit my hold.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  I am most sick at heart—nay, grasp me not—<br>
      I am all feebleness—the mountains whirl<br>
      Spinning around me—I grow blind—What art thou?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  I’ll answer that <span class="tooltip">anon<span class="tooltiptext">soon; shortly</span></span>.—Away with me!<br>
      The clouds grow thicker—there—now lean on me—<br>
      Place your foot here—here, take this staff, and cling<br>
      A moment to that shrub—now give me your hand,<br>
      And hold fast by my girdle—softly—well—<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">Chalet<span class="tooltiptext">a wooden house or cottage, typically found in the Swiss Alps.</span></span> will be gain’d within an hour.<br>
      Come on, we’ll quickly find a surer footing,<br>
      And something like a pathway, which the torrent<br>
      Hath wash’d since winter.—Come, ’tis bravely done;<br>
      Your should have been a hunter.—Follow me.  [As they descend the rocks with difficulty, the scene closes.]
      </p>

      <h2>Act II</h2>

      <h2>Scene I</h2>

      <h3>A Cottage amongst the Bernese Alps.</h3>

      <h3>MANFRED and the CHAMOIS HUNTER.</h3>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  No, no, yet pause, thou must not yet go forth:<br>
      Thy mind and body are alike unfit<br>
      To trust each other, for some hours, at least;<br>
      When thou art better, I will be thy guide—<br>
      But whither?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>              It imports not; I do know<br>
      My route full well and need no further guidance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  Thy garb and gait bespeak thee of high lineage—<br>
      One of the many chiefs, whose castled crags<br>
      Look o’er the lower valleys—which of these<br>
      May call thee lord? I only know their portals;<br>
      My way of life leads me but rarely down<br>
      To bask by the huge hearths of those old halls,<br>
      Carousing with the <span class="tooltip">vassals<span class="tooltiptext">a person regarded as having a mutual obligation to a lord or monarch, in the context of the feudal system in medieval Europe; a person or country in a subordinate position to another.</span></span>; but the paths,<br>
      Which step from out our mountains to their doors,<br>
      I know from childhood—which of these is thine?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  No matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>            Well, sir, pardon me the question,<br>
      And be of better cheer. Come, taste my wine;<br>
      ’Tis of an ancient vintage; many a day<br>
      ’T has thaw’d my veins among our glaciers, now<br>
      Let it do thus for thine. Come, pledge me fairly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  Away, away! there’s blood upon the brim!<br>
      Will it then never—never sink in the earth?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  What dost thou mean? thy senses wander from thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  I say ’tis blood—my blood! the pure warm stream<br>
      Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours<br>
      When we were in our youth, and had one heart,<br>
      And loved each other as we should not love,<br>
      And this was shed: but still it rises up,<br>
      Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from heaven,<br>
      Where thou art not—and I shall never be.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  Man of strange words, and some half—maddening sin,<br>
      Which makes thee people vacancy, whate’er<br>
      Thy dread and sufferance be, there’s comfort yet—<br>
      The aid of holy men, and heavenly patience—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  Patience and patience! Hence—that word was made<br>
      For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey;<br>
      Preach it to mortals of a dust like thine,—<br>
      I am not of thine order.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>                Thanks to heaven!<br>
      I would not be of thine for the free fame<br>
      Of William Tell; but whatsoe’er thine ill,<br>
      It must be borne, and these wild starts are useless.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  Do I not bear it?—Look on me—I live.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  This is convulsion, and no healthful life.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  I tell thee, man! I have lived many years,<br>
      Many long years, but they are nothing now<br>
      To those which I must number: ages—ages—<br>
      Space and eternity—and consciousness,<br>
      With the fierce thirst of death—and still <span class="tooltip">unslaked<span class="tooltiptext">not quenched or satisfied</span></span>!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  Why, on thy brow the seal of middle age<br>
      Hath scarce been set; I am thine elder far.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  Think’st thou existence doth depend on time?<br>
      It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine<br>
      Have made my days and nights imperishable,<br>
      Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,<br>
      Innumerable atoms; and one desert,<br>
      Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,<br>
      But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,<br>
      Rocks, and the salt—surf weeds of bitterness.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  Alas! he’s mad—but yet I must not leave him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  I would I were, for then the things I see<br>
      Could be but a distemper’d dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>                What is it<br>
      That thou dost see, or think thou look’st upon?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  Myself, and thee—a peasant of the Alps,<br>
      Thy humble virtues, hospitable home,<br>
      And spirit patient, pious, proud and free;<br>
      Thy self-respect, grafted on innocent thoughts;<br>
      Thy days of health, and nights of sleep; thy toils,<br>
      By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes<br>
      Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,<br>
      With cross and garland over its green turf,<br>
      And thy grandchildren’s love for epitaph;<br>
      This do I see—and then I look within—<br>
      It matters not—my soul was scorch’d already!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>  And wouldst thou then exchange thy lot for mine?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>  No, friend! I would not wrong thee nor exchange<br>
      My lot with living being: I can bear—<br>
      However wretchedly, ’tis still to bear—<br>
      In life what others could not brook to dream,<br>
      But perish in their slumber.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>                And with this—<br>
      This cautious feeling for another’s pain,<br>
      Canst thou be black with evil?—say not so.<br>
      Can one of gentle thoughts have wreak’d revenge<br>
      Upon his enemies?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>                Oh! no, no, no!<br>
      My injuries came down on those who loved me—<br>
      On those whom I best loved: I never quell’d<br>
      An enemy, save in my just defence—<br>
      But my embrace was fatal.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>C. Hun.</em>                Heaven give thee rest!<br>
      And <span class="tooltip">penitence<span class="tooltiptext">the action of feeling or showing sorrow and regret for having done wrong; repentance.</span></span> restore thee to thyself;<br>
      My prayers shall be for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Man.</em>                I need them not,<br>
      But can endure thy pity. I depart—<br>
      ’Tis time—farewell!—Here’s gold, and thanks for thee;<br>
      No words—it is thy due. Follow me not;<br>
      I know my path—the mountain peril’s past:<br>
      And once again, I charge thee, follow not!  [Exit MANFRED]
