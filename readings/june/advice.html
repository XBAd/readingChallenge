           (baptised 24 August 1591–buried 15 October 1674) was a 17th-century English

      <h2>Cherry-Ripe</h2>

      <p>
        CHERRY-RIPE, ripe, ripe, I cry, <br>
        Full and fair ones; come and buy.<br>
        If so be you ask me where<br>
        They do grow, I answer: There<br>
        Where my Julia’s lips do smile;<br>
        There’s the land, or cherry-isle,<br>
        Whose plantations fully show<br>
        All the year where cherries grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Child’s Grace<br>
        HERE a little child I stand<br>
        Heaving up my either hand;<br>
        Cold as <span class="tooltip">paddocks<span class="tooltiptext">a usually enclosed area used especially for pasturing or exercising animals</span></span> though they be.<br>
        Here I lift them up to Thee,<br>
        For a <span class="tooltip">benison<span class="tooltiptext">blessing</span></span> to fall<br>
        On our meat and on us all. Amen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Mad Maid’s Song<br>
        GOOD-MORROW to the day so fair,<br>
          Good-morning, sir, to you;<br>
        Good-morrow to mine own torn hair<br>
          Bedabbled with the dew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good-morning to this primrose too,<br>
          Good-morrow to each maid<br>
        That will with flowers the tomb bestrew<br>
          Wherein my love is laid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah! woe is me, woe, woe is me!<br>
          Alack and well-a-day!<br>
        For pity, sir, find out that bee<br>
          Which bore my love away.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll seek him in your bonnet brave,<br>
          I’ll seek him in your eyes;<br>
        Nay, now I think they’ve made his grave<br>
          I’ th’ bed of strawberries.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll seek him there; I know ere this<br>
          The cold, cold earth doth shake him;<br>
        But I will go, or send a kiss<br>
          By you, sir, to awake him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pray hurt him not; though he be dead,<br>
          He knows well who do love him,<br>
        And who with green turfs rear his head,<br>
          And who do rudely move him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He’s soft and tender (pray take heed);<br>
          With bands of <span class="tooltip">cowslips<span class="tooltiptext">a European primula with clusters of drooping fragrant yellow flowers in spring, growing on dry grassy banks and in pasture; any of a number of herbaceous plants.</span></span> bind him,<br>
        And bring him home—but ’tis decreed<br>
          That I shall never find him!
      </p>

      <h2>To the Virgins</h2>

      <p>
        GATHER ye rose-buds while ye may,<br>
          Old Time is still a-flying:<br>
        And this same flower that smiles to-day,<br>
          To-morrow will be dying.
      </p>

      <p>
        The glorious Lamp of Heaven, the Sun,<br>
          The higher he’s a-getting<br>
        The sooner will his race be run,<br>
          And nearer he’s to setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        That age is best which is the first,<br>
          When youth and blood are warmer;<br>
        But being spent, the worse, and worst<br>
          Times, still succeed the former.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then be not coy, but use your time;<br>
          And while ye may, go marry:<br>
        For having lost but once your prime,<br>
          You may for ever <span class="tooltip">tarry<span class="tooltiptext">wait; to delay or be tardy in acting or doing; to linger in expectation</span></span>.
      </p>

      <h2>To Dianeme</h2>

      <p>
        SWEET, be not proud of those two eyes<br>
        Which starlike sparkle in their skies;<br>
        Nor be you proud, that you can see<br>
        All hearts your captives; yours yet free:<br>
        Be you not proud of that rich hair<br>
        Which <span class="tooltip">wantons<span class="tooltiptext">plays; frolics</span></span> with the lovesick air;<br>
        Whenas that ruby which you wear,<br>
        Sunk from the tip of your soft ear,<br>
        Will last to be a precious stone<br>
        When all your world of beauty’s gone.
      </p>

      <h2>A Sweet Disorder</h2>

      <p>
        A SWEET disorder in the dress<br>
        Kindles in clothes a wantonness:—<br>
        A lawn about the shoulders thrown<br>
        Into a fine distractión,—<br>
        An erring lace, which here and there<br>
        Enthrals the crimson stomacher,—<br>
        A cuff neglectful, and thereby<br>
        Ribbands to flow confusedly,—<br>
        A winning wave, deserving note,<br>
        In the tempestuous petticoat,—<br>
        A careless shoe-string, in whose tie<br>
        I see a wild civility,—<br>
        Do more bewitch me, than when art<br>
        Is too precise in every part.
      </p>

      <h2>Whenas in Silks</h2>

      <p>
        WHENAS in silks my Julia goes<br>
        Then, then (methinks) how sweetly flows<br>
        That liquefaction of her clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, when I cast mine eyes and see<br>
        That brave vibration each way free;<br>
        O how that glittering taketh me!
      </p>

      <h2>To Anthea who may Command Him Any Thing</h2>

      <p>
        BID me to live, and I will live<br>
          Thy Protestant to be:<br>
        Or bid me love, and I will give<br>
          A loving heart to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        A heart as soft, a heart as kind,<br>
          A heart as sound and free<br>
        As in the whole world thou canst find,<br>
          That heart I’ll give to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bid that heart stay, and it will stay,<br>
          To honour thy decree:<br>
        Or bid it languish quite away,<br>
          And ’t shall do so for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bid me to weep, and I will weep<br>
          While I have eyes to see:<br>
        And having none, yet I will keep<br>
          A heart to weep for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bid me despair, and I’ll despair,<br>
          Under that cypress tree:<br>
        Or bid me die, and I will dare<br>
          E’en Death, to die for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou art my life, my love, my heart,<br>
          The very eyes of me,<br>
        And hast command of every part,<br>
          To live and die for thee.
      </p>

      <h2>To Daffodils</h2>

      <p>
        FAIR Daffodils, we weep to see<br>
            You haste away so soon:<br>
        As yet the early-rising Sun<br>
            Has not attain’d his noon.<br>
                Stay, stay,<br>
            Until the hasting day<br>
                Has run<br>
            But to the <span class="tooltip">even-song<span class="tooltiptext">(in the Christian Church) a service of evening prayers, psalms, and canticles, conducted according to a set form, especially that of the Anglican Church.</span></span>;<br>
        And, having pray’d together, we<br>
            Will go with you along.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have short time to stay, as you,<br>
            We have as short a Spring!<br>
        As quick a growth to meet decay<br>
            As you, or any thing.<br>
                We die,<br>
            As your hours do, and dry<br>
                Away<br>
            Like to the Summer’s rain;<br>
        Or as the pearls of morning’s dew<br>
            Ne’er to be found again.
      </p>

      <h2>To Blossoms</h2>

      <p>
        FAIR pledges of a fruitful tree,<br>
            Why do ye fall so fast?<br>
            Your date is not so past,<br>
        But you may stay yet here awhile<br>
            To blush and gently smile,<br>
                And go at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        What, were ye born to be<br>
            An hour or half’s delight,<br>
            And so to bid good-night?<br>
        ’Twas pity Nature brought ye forth<br>
            Merely to show your worth,<br>
                And lose you quite.
      </p>

      <p>
        But you are lovely leaves, where we<br>
            May read how soon things have<br>
            Their end, though ne’er so brave:<br>
        And after they have shown their pride<br>
            Like you, awhile, they glide<br>
                Into the grave.
      </p>

      <h2>Corinna’s Maying</h2>

      <p>
        GET up, get up for shame! The blooming morn<br>
        Upon her wings presents the god unshorn.<br>
        See how <span class="tooltip">Aurora<span class="tooltiptext">the Roman goddess of dawn</span></span> throws her fair<br>
        Fresh-quilted colours through the air:<br>
        Get up, sweet <span class="tooltip">slug-a-bed<span class="tooltiptext">a lazy person who stays in bed late.</span></span>, and see<br>
        The dew-bespangling herb and tree!<br>
    Each flower has wept and bow’d toward the east,<br>
    Above an hour since, yet you not drest;<br>
        Nay! not so much as out of bed?<br>
        When all the birds have <span class="tooltip">matins<span class="tooltiptext">the morning song of birds; a service of morning prayer in various churches, especially the Anglican Church.</span></span> said,<br>
        And sung their thankful hymns, ’tis sin,<br>
        Nay, profanation, to keep in,<br>
    Whenas a thousand virgins on this day<br>
    Spring, sooner than the lark, to fetch in May.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rise, and put on your foliage, and be seen<br>
        To come forth, like the spring-time, fresh and green,<br>
            And sweet as Flora. Take no care<br>
            For jewels for your gown or hair:<br>
            Fear not; the leaves will strew<br>
            Gems in abundance upon you:<br>
        Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,<br>
        Against you come, some orient pearls unwept.<br>
            Come, and receive them while the light<br>
            Hangs on the dew-locks of the night,<br>
            And Titan on the eastern hill<br>
            Retires himself, or else stands still<br>
        Till you come forth! Wash, dress, be brief in praying:<br>
        Few beads are best when once we go a-Maying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Come, my Corinna, come; and coming, mark<br>
        How each field turns a street, each street a park,<br>
            Made green and trimm’d with trees! see how<br>
            Devotion gives each house a bough<br>
            Or branch! each porch, each door, ere this,<br>
            An ark, a <span class="tooltip">tabernacle<span class="tooltiptext">(in biblical use) a fixed or movable habitation, typically of light construction; a house of worship; a tent sanctuary used by the Israelites during the Exodus</span></span> is,<br>
        Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove,<br>
        As if here were those cooler shades of love.<br>
            Can such delights be in the street<br>
            And open fields, and we not see ’t?<br>
            Come, we’ll abroad: and let’s obey<br>
            The proclamation made for May,<br>
        And sin no more, as we have done, by staying<br>
        But, my Corinna, come, let’s go a-Maying.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s not a budding boy or girl this day<br>
        But is got up and gone to bring in May.<br>
            A deal of youth, ere this, is come<br>
            Back, and with white-thorn laden home.<br>
            Some have dispatch’d their cakes and cream,<br>
            Before that we have left to dream:<br>
        And some have wept and woo’d, and plighted troth,<br>
        And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:<br>
            Many a green-gown has been given,<br>
            Many a kiss, both odd and even:<br>
            Many a glance, too, has been sent<br>
            From out the eye, love’s firmament:<br>
        Many a jest told of the keys betraying<br>
        This night, and locks pick’d: yet we’re not a-Maying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Come, let us go, while we are in our prime,<br>
        And take the harmless folly of the time!<br>
            We shall grow old apace, and die<br>
            Before we know our liberty.<br>
            Our life is short, and our days run<br>
            As fast away as does the sun.<br>
        And, as a vapour or a drop of rain,<br>
        Once lost, can ne’er be found again,<br>
            So when or you or I are made<br>
            A fable, song, or fleeting shade,<br>
            All love, all liking, all delight<br>
            Lies drowned with us in endless night.<br>
        Then, while time serves, and we are but decaying,<br>
        Come, my Corinna, come, let’s go a-Maying.
