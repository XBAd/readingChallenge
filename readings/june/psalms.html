      <h2>Jehovah the Psalmist’s Shepherd</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        JEHOVAH is my shepherd; <br>
        I shall not want. <br>
        [2]
        He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; <br>
        He leadeth me beside still waters. <br>
        [3]
        He restoreth my soul: <br>
        He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. <br>
        [4]
        Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, <br>
        I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; <br>
        Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. <br>
        [5]
        Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: <br>
        Thou hast anointed my head with oil; <br>
        My cup runneth over. <br>
        [6]
        Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life; <br>
        And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.
      </p>

      <h2>XXIV</h2>

      <h2>The King of Glory Entering Zion</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        THE EARTH is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof;<br>
        The world, and they that dwell therein.<br>
        [2]
        For he hath founded it upon the seas,<br>
        And established it upon the floods.<br>
        [3]
        Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah?<br>
        And who shall stand in his holy place?<br>
        [4]
        He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;<br>
        Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood,<br>
        And hath not sworn deceitfully.<br>
        [5]
        He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah,<br>
        And righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br>
        [6]
        This is the generation of them that seek after him,<br>
        That seek thy face, even Jacob.  [Selah]
      </p>

      <p>
        [7]
        Lift up your heads, O ye gates;<br>
        And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors:<br>
        And the King of glory will come in.<br>
        [8]
        Who is the King of glory?<br>
        Jehovah strong and mighty,<br>
        Jehovah mighty in battle.<br>
        [9]
        Lift up your heads, O ye gates;<br>
        Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors:<br>
        And the King of glory will come in.<br>
        [10]
        Who is this King of glory?<br>
        Jehovah of hosts,<br>
        He is the King of glory.  [Selah]
      </p>

      <h2>Prayer for Protection, Guidance, and Pardon</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        UNTO thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.<br>
        [2]
        O my God, in thee have I trusted,<br>
        Let me not be put to shame;<br>
        Let not mine enemies triumph over me.<br>
        [3]
        Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame:<br>
        They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause.<br>
        [4]
        Show me thy ways, O Jehovah;<br>
        Teach me thy paths.<br>
        [5]
        Guide me in thy truth, and teach me;<br>
        For thou art the God of my salvation;<br>
        For thee do I wait all the day.<br>
        [6]
        Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy loving kindnesses;<br>
        For they have been ever of old.<br>
        [7]
        Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:<br>
        According to thy loving kindness remember thou me,<br>
        For thy goodness’ sake, O Jehovah.<br>
        [8]
        Good and upright is Jehovah:<br>
        Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.<br>
        [9]
        The meek will he guide in justice;<br>
        And the meek will he teach his way.<br>
        [10]
        All the paths of Jehovah are loving kindness and truth<br>
        Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<br>
        [11]
        For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah,<br>
        Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.<br>
        [12]
        What man is he that feareth Jehovah?<br>
        Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.<br>
        [13]
        His soul shall dwell at ease;<br>
        And his seed shall inherit the land.<br>
        [14]
        The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him;<br>
        And he will show them his covenant.<br>
        [15]
        Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah;<br>
        For he will pluck my feet out of the net.<br>
        [16]
        Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me;<br>
        For I am desolate and afflicted.<br>
        [17]
        The troubles of my heart are enlarged:<br>
        Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.<br>
        [18]
        Consider mine affliction and my travail;<br>
        And forgive all my sins.<br>
        [19]
        Consider mine enemies, for they are many;<br>
        And they hate me with cruel hatred.<br>
        [20]
        Oh keep my soul, and deliver me:<br>
        Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.<br>
        [21]
        Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,<br>
        For I wait for thee.<br>
        [22]
        Redeem Israel, O God,<br>
        Out of all his troubles.
      </p>

      <h2>XXVI</h2>

      <h2>Protestation of Integrity, and Prayer for Protection</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        JUDGE me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity:<br>
        I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering.<br>
        [2]
        Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me;<br>
        Try my heart and my mind.<br>
        [3]
        For thy loving kindness is before mine eyes;<br>
        And I have walked in thy truth.<br>
        [4]
        I have not sat with men of falsehood;<br>
        Neither will I go in with dissemblers.<br>
        [5]
        I hate the assembly of evildoers,<br>
        And will not sit with the wicked.<br>
        [6]
        I will wash my hands in innocency:<br>
        So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah;<br>
        [7]
        That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,<br>
        And tell of all thy wondrous works.<br>
        [8]
        Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house,<br>
        And the place where thy glory dwelleth.<br>
        [9]
        Gather not my soul with sinners,<br>
        Nor my life with men of blood;<br>
        [10]
        In whose hands is wickedness,<br>
        And their right hand is full of bribes.<br>
        [11]
        But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:<br>
        Redeem me, and be merciful unto me.<br>
        [12]
        My foot standeth in an even place:<br>
        In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
      </p>

      <h2>XXVII</h2>

      <h2>A Psalm of Fearless Trust in God</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        JEHOVAH is my light and my salvation;<br>
        Whom shall I fear?<br>
        Jehovah is the strength of my life;<br>
        Of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
        [2]
        When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh,<br>
        Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.<br>
        [3]
        Though a host should encamp against me,<br>
        My heart shall not fear:<br>
        Though war should rise against me,<br>
        Even then will I be confident.<br>
        [4]
        One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after:<br>
        That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life,<br>
        To behold the beauty of Jehovah,<br>
        And to inquire in his temple.<br>
        [5]
        For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion:<br>
        In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me;<br>
        He will lift me up upon a rock.<br>
        [6]
        And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me;<br>
        And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;<br>
        I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.
      </p>

      <p>
        [7]
        Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice:<br>
        Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.<br>
        [8]
        When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,<br>
        Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.<br>
        [9]
        Hide not thy face from me;<br>
        Put not thy servant away in anger:<br>
        Thou hast been my help;<br>
        Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.<br>
        [10]
        When my father and my mother forsake me,<br>
        Then Jehovah will take me up.<br>
        [11]
        Teach me thy way, O Jehovah;<br>
        And lead me in a plain path,<br>
        Because of mine enemies.<br>
        [12]
        Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries:<br>
        For false witnesses are risen up against me,<br>
        And such as breathe out cruelty.<br>
        [13]
        I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah<br>
        In the land of the living.<br>
        [14]
        Wait for Jehovah:<br>
        Be strong, and let thy heart take courage;<br>
        Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.
      </p>

      <h2>XXVIII</h2>

      <h2>A Prayer for Help, and Praise for Its Answer</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        UNTO thee, O Jehovah, will I call:<br>
        My rock, be not thou deaf unto me;<br>
        Lest, if thou be silent unto me,<br>
        I become like them that go down into the pit.<br>
        [2]
        Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,<br>
        When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.<br>
        [3]
        Draw me not away with the wicked,<br>
        And with the workers of iniquity;<br>
        That speak peace with their neighbors,<br>
        But mischief is in their hearts.<br>
        [4]
        Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:<br>
        Give them after the operation of their hands;<br>
        Render to them their desert.<br>
        [5]
        Because they regard not the works of Jehovah,<br>
        Nor the operation of his hands,<br>
        He will break them down and not build them up.
      </p>

      <p>
        [6]
        Blessed be Jehovah,<br>
        Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.<br>
        [7]
        Jehovah is my strength and my shield;<br>
        My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped:<br>
        Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;<br>
        And with my song will I praise him.<br>
        [8]
        Jehovah is their strength,<br>
        And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.<br>
        Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:<br>
        Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.
      </p>

      <h2>XXIX</h2>

      <h2>The Voice of Jehovah in the Storm</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        ASCRIBE unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty,<br>
        Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.<br>
        [2]
        Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name;<br>
        Worship Jehovah in holy array.
      </p>

      <p>
        [3]
        The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters:<br>
        The God of glory thundereth,<br>
        Even Jehovah upon many waters.<br>
        [4]
        The voice of Jehovah is powerful;<br>
        The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.<br>
        [5]
        The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars;<br>
        Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.<br>
        [6]
        He maketh them also to skip like a calf;<br>
        Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.<br>
        [7]
        The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire.<br>
        [8]
        The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness;<br>
        Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.<br>
        [9]
        The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve,<br>
        And strippeth the forests bare:<br>
        And in his temple everything saith, Glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        [10]
        Jehovah sat as King at the Flood;<br>
        Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever.<br>
        [11]
        Jehovah will give strength unto his people;<br>
        Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
      </p>

      <h2>XXX</h2>

      <h2>Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Death</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        I WILL extol thee, O Jehovah; for thou hast raised me up,<br>
        And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.<br>
        [2]
        O Jehovah my God,<br>
        I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.<br>
        [3]
        O Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol;<br>
        Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.<br>
        [4]
        Sing praise unto Jehovah, O ye saints of his,<br>
        And give thanks to his holy memorial name.<br>
        [5]
        For his anger is but for a moment;<br>
        His favor is for a life-time:<br>
        Weeping may tarry for the night,<br>
        But joy cometh in the morning.<br>
        [6]
        As for me, I said in my prosperity,<br>
        I shall never be moved.<br>
        [7]
        Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong:<br>
        Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.<br>
        [8]
        I cried to thee, O Jehovah;<br>
        And unto Jehovah I made supplication:<br>
        [9]
        What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?<br>
        Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?<br>
        [10]
        Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me:<br>
        Jehovah, be thou my helper.<br>
        [11]
        Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing;<br>
        Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;<br>
        [12]
        To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.<br>
        O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
      </p>

      <h2>XXXI</h2>

      <h2>A Psalm of Complaint and of Praise</h2>

      <h3>For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        IN thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge;<br>
        Let me never be put to shame:<br>
        Deliver me in thy righteousness.<br>
        [2]
        Bow down thine ear unto me; deliver me speedily:<br>
        Be thou to me a strong rock,<br>
        A house of defence to save me.<br>
        [3]
        For thou art my rock and my fortress;<br>
        Therefore for thy name’s sake lead me and guide me.<br>
        [4]
        Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;<br>
        For thou art my stronghold.<br>
        [5]
        Into thy hand I commend my spirit:<br>
        Thou hast redeemed me, O Jehovah, thou God of truth.<br>
        [6]
        I hate them that regard lying vanities;<br>
        But I trust in Jehovah.<br>
        [7]
        I will be glad and rejoice in thy lovingkindness;<br>
        For thou hast seen my affliction:<br>
        Thou hast known my soul in adversities;<br>
        [8]
        And thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy;<br>
        Thou hast set my feet in a large place.<br>
        [9]
        Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress:<br>
        Mine eye wasteth away with grief, yea, my soul and my body.<br>
        [10]
        For my life is spent with sorrow,<br>
        And my years with sighing:<br>
        My strength faileth because of mine iniquity,<br>
        And my bones are wasted away.<br>
        [11]
        Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,<br>
        Yea, unto my neighbors exceedingly,<br>
        And a fear to mine acquaintance:<br>
        They that did see me without fled from me.<br>
        [12]
        I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:<br>
        I am like a broken vessel.<br>
        [13]
        For I have heard the defaming of many,<br>
        Terror on every side:<br>
        While they took counsel together against me,<br>
        They devised to take away my life.<br>
        [14]
        But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah:<br>
        I said, Thou art my God.<br>
        [15]
        My times are in thy hand:<br>
        Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.<br>
        [16]
        Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:<br>
        Save me in thy loving kindness.<br>
        [17]
        Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah; for I have called upon thee:<br>
        Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.<br>
        [18]
        Let the lying lips be dumb,<br>
        Which speak against the righteous insolently,<br>
        With pride and contempt.<br>
        [19]
        Oh how great is thy goodness,<br>
        Which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee,<br>
        Which thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in thee,<br>
        Before the sons of men!<br>
        [20]
        In the covert of thy presence wilt thou hide them from the plottings of man:<br>
        Thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.<br>
        [21]
        Blessed be Jehovah;<br>
        For he hath showed me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city.<br>
        [22]
        As for me, I said in my haste,<br>
        I am cut off from before thine eyes:<br>
        Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications,<br>
        When I cried unto thee.<br>
        [23]
        Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints:<br>
        Jehovah preserveth the faithful,<br>
        And plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly.<br>
        [24]
        Be strong, and let your heart take courage,<br>
        All ye that hope in Jehovah.

      <h2>XXXII</h2>

      <h2>Blessedness of Forgiveness and of Trust in God</h2>

      <h3>A Psalm of David. Maschil.</h3>

      <p>
        [1]
        BLESSED is he whose transgression is forgiven,<br>
        Whose sin is covered.<br>
        [2]
        Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity,<br>
        And in whose spirit there is no guile.<br>
        [3]
        When I kept silence, my bones wasted away<br>
        Through my groaning all the day long.<br>
        [4]
        For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:<br>
        My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer.  [Selah]
      </p>

      <p>
        [5]
        I acknowledged my sin unto thee,<br>
        And mine iniquity did I not hide:<br>
        I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah;<br>
        And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.  [Selah]<br>
        [6]
        For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found:<br>
        Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.<br>
        [7]
        Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble;<br>
        Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance.  [Selah]<br>
        [8]
        I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:<br>
        I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.<br>
        [9]
        Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding;<br>
        Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in,<br>
        Else they will not come near unto thee.<br>
        [10]
        Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;<br>
        But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.<br>
        [11]
        Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous;<br>
        And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
