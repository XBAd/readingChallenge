      <h2>Act IV</h2>

      <h2>Scene V</h2>

      <h3>[Elsinore. A room in the castle]</h3>

      <em>Enter QUEEN, HORATIO [and a Gentleman]</em>

      <p>
        <em>Queen.</em>  I will not speak with her. <br>
        <em>[Gent.]</em>  She is importunate, indeed distract.<br>
      Her mood will needs be pitied.<br>
        <em>Queen.</em>        What would she have?<br>
        <em>[Gent.]</em>  She speaks much of her father; says she hears<br>
      There’s tricks i’ the world, and hems, and beats her heart,<br>
      Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt<br>
      That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,<br>
      Yet the unshaped use of it doth move<br>
      The hearers to collection. They aim at it<br>
      And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;<br>
      Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,<br>
      Indeed would make one think there would be thought,<br>
      Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.<br>
        <em>[Hor.]</em>  ’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew<br>
      Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.<br>
      Let her come in.  [Exit Gentleman.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Queen.  [Aside.]</em>  To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is,<br>
      Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss;<br>
      So full of artless jealousy is guilt,<br>
      It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
      </p>

      <em>Enter OPHELIA, distracted</em>

      <p>
        <em>Oph.</em>  Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?<br>
        <em>Queen.</em>  How now, Ophelia!<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “How should I your true love know<br>
              From another one?<br>
          By his cockle hat and staff,<br>
              And his sandal shoon.”
        </blockquote>

        <em>Queen.</em>  Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “He is dead and gone, lady,<br>
              He is dead and gone;<br>
          At his head a grass-green turf<br>
              At his heels a stone.”
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <em>Enter KING</em>

      <p>
        <em>Queen.</em>  Nay, but, Ophelia,—<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  Pray you, mark.  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “White his shroud as the mountain snow,”—
        </blockquote>

        <em>Queen.</em>  Alas, look here, my lord.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “Larded with sweet flowers;<br>
      Which bewept to the grave did not go<br>
          With true-love showers.”
        </blockquote>

        <em>King.</em>  How do you, pretty lady?<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  Well, God ild you! They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!<br>
        <em>King.</em>  Conceit upon her father.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  Pray you, let’s have no words of this, but when they ask you what it means, say you this:  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “To-morrow is Saint Valentine’s day,<br>
              All in the morning betime,<br>
          And I a maid at your window,<br>
              To be your Valentine.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes,<br>
              And dupp’d the chamber door;<br>
          Let in the maid, that out a maid<br>
              Never departed more.”
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>King.</em>  Pretty Ophelia!<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  Indeed, la, without an oath I’ll make an end on’t.

        <blockquote>
          “By Gis, and by Saint Charity,<br>
              Alack! and, fie for shame!<br>
          Young men will do’t, if they come to ’t;<br>
              By Cock, they are to blame.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “Quoth she, ‘Before you tumbled me,<br>
              You promis’d me to wed.’<br>
          ‘So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,<br>
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.’ ”
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>King.</em>  How long hath she been thus?<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i’ the cold ground. My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good-night, ladies; good-night, sweet ladies; good-night, good-night.  Exit.<br>
        <em>King.</em>  Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.  [Exeunt some.]<br>
      O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs<br>
      All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br>
      When sorrows come, they come not single spies,<br>
      But in battalions. First, her father slain;<br>
      Next, your son gone; and he most violent author<br>
      Of his own just remove; the people muddied,<br>
      Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,<br>
      For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly<br>
      In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia<br>
      Divided from herself and her fair judgement,<br>
      Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts;<br>
      Last, and as much containing as all these,<br>
      Her brother is in secret come from France,<br>
      Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br>
      And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br>
      With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,<br>
      Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d,<br>
      Will nothing stick our persons to arraign<br>
      In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,<br>
      Like to a murdering-piece, in many places<br>
      Gives me superfluous death.  A noise within.
      </p>

      <em>Enter a Messenger</em>

      <p>
        <em>Queen.</em>        Alack, what noise is this?<br>
        <em>King.</em>  Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. What is the matter?<br>
        <em>Mess.</em>        Save yourself, my lord!<br>
      The ocean, overpeering of his list,<br>
      Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste<br>
      Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,<br>
      O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;<br>
      And, as the world were now but to begin,<br>
      Antiquity forgot, custom not known,<br>
      (The ratifiers and props of every word,)<br>
      They cry, “Choose we! Laertes shall be king!”<br>
      Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,<br>
      “Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!”<br>
        <em>Queen.</em>  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!<br>
      O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
      </p>

      <em>Enter LAERTES [armed; Danes following]</em>

      <p>
        <em>King.</em>  The doors are broke.  Noise within.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.<br>
        <em>Danes.</em>  No, let’s come in.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>        I pray you, give me leave.<br>
        <em>Danes.</em>  We will, we will.  [They retire without the door.]<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  I thank you; keep the door. O thou vile king,<br>
      Give me my father!<br>
        <em>Queen.</em>        Calmly, good Laertes.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard,<br>
      Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot<br>
      Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brows<br>
      Of my true mother.<br>
        <em>King.</em>        What is the cause, Laertes,<br>
      That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?<br>
      Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person.<br>
      There’s such divinity doth hedge a king,<br>
      That treason can but peep to what it would,<br>
      Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,<br>
      Why thou art thus incens’d. Let him go, Gertrude.<br>
      Speak, man.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  Where’s my father?<br>
        <em>King.</em>        Dead.<br>
        <em>Queen.</em>        But not by him.<br>
        <em>King.</em>  Let him demand his fill.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  How came he dead? I’ll not be juggl’d with.<br>
      To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!<br>
      Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!<br>
      I dare damnation. To this point I stand,<br>
      That both the worlds I give to negligence,<br>
      Let come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d<br>
      Most throughly for my father.<br>
        <em>King.</em>        Who shall stay you?<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  My will, not all the world.<br>
      And for my means, I’ll husband them so well,<br>
      They shall go far with little.<br>
        <em>King.</em>        Good Laertes,<br>
      If you desire to know the certainty<br>
      Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge<br>
      That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,<br>
      Winner and loser?<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  None but his enemies.<br>
        <em>King.</em>        Will you know them then?<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms,<br>
      And like the kind life-rend’ring pelican,<br>
      Repast them with my blood.<br>
        <em>King.</em>        Why, now you speak<br>
      Like a good child and a true gentleman.<br>
      That I am guiltless of your father’s death,<br>
      And am most sensibly in grief for it,<br>
      It shall as level to your judgement pierce<br>
      As day does to your eye.<br>
              A noise within: “Let her come in!”
      </p>

      <em>Re-enter OPHELIA</em>

      <p>
        <em>Laer.</em>  How now! what noise is that?<br>
      O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt<br>
      Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!<br>
      By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight<br>
      Till our scale turns the beam. O rose of May!<br>
      Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!<br>
      O heavens! is’t possible, a young maid’s wits<br>
      Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?<br>
      Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine,<br>
      It sends some precious instance of itself<br>
      After the thing it loves.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “They bore him barefac’d on the bier;<br>
          Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;<br>
          And on his grave rains many a tear,”—
        </blockquote>

      Fare you well, my dove!<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,<br>
      It could not move thus.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  You must sing, “Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.” O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his master’s daughter.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  This nothing’s more than matter.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray, love, remember; and there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.<br>
        <em>Laer.</em>  A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  There’s fennel for you, and columbines; there’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; we may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O, you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say he made a good end,—  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.”
        </blockquote>

        <em>Laer.</em>  Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness.<br>
        <em>Oph.</em>  [Sings.]

        <blockquote>
          “And will he not come again?<br>
          And will he not come again?<br>
              No, no, he is dead;<br>
              Go to thy death-bed;<br>
          He never will come again.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “His beard as white as snow,<br>
          All flaxen was his poll.<br>
              He is gone, he is gone,<br>
              And we cast away moan.<br>
          God ha’ mercy on his soul!”
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God buy ye.  Exit.<br>
          <em>Laer.</em>  Do you see this, you gods?<br>
          <em>King.</em>  Laertes, I must commune with your grief,<br>
        Or you deny me right. Go but apart,<br>
        Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,<br>
        And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.<br>
        If by direct or by collateral hand<br>
        They find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give,<br>
        Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,<br>
        To you in satisfaction; but if not,<br>
        Be you content to lend your patience to us,<br>
        And we shall jointly labour with your soul<br>
        To give it due content.<br>
          <em>Laer.</em>        Let this be so.<br>
        His means of death, his obscure burial—<br>
        No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,<br>
        No noble rite nor formal ostentation—<br>
        Cry to be heard, as ’t were from heaven to earth,<br>
        That I must call ’t in question.<br>
          <em>King.</em>        So you shall;<br>
        And where the offence is let the great axe fall.<br>
        I pray you, go with me.  Exeunt.
