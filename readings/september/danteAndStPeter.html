        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy" target="_blank"><em>The Divine Comedy</em></a>
           is a long Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308
           and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely
           considered to be the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one
           of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative
           vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view
           as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century.
           It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written
           (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the
           standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts:
           <em>Inferno</em>, <em>Purgatorio</em>, and <em>Paradiso</em>.
           The narrative describes Dante's travels through Hell,
           Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven, while allegorically the poem
           represents the soul's journey towards God. Dante draws on medieval
           Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy
           derived from the <em>Summa Theologica</em> of Thomas Aquinas.
           Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called "the Summa in verse".
           In Dante's work, Virgil is presented as human reason and
           Beatrice is presented as divine knowledge.

      <h2>Inferno [Hell]</h2>

      <h2>Canto XXIV</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—Under the escort of his faithful master, Dante not without difficulty makes his way out of the sixth gulf; and in the seventh, sees the robbers tormented by venomous and pestilent serpents. The soul of Vanni Fucci, who had pillaged the sacristy of St. James in Pistoia, predicts some calamities that impended over that city, and over the Florentines.
      </p>

      <p>
        IN the year’s early <span class="tooltip">nonage<span class="tooltiptext">the period of immaturity or youth.</span></span>, when the sun <br>
        Tempers his <span class="tooltip">tresses<span class="tooltiptext">a long lock of a woman's hair.</span></span> in Aquarius’ urn,<br>
        And now toward equal day the nights recede;<br>
        Whenas the <span class="tooltip">rime<span class="tooltiptext">frost formed on cold objects by the rapid freezing of water vapor in cloud or fog.</span></span> upon the earth puts on<br>
        Her dazzling sister’s image, but not long<br>
        Her milder sway endures; then riseth up<br>
        The village <span class="tooltip">hind<span class="tooltiptext">a skilled farm worker.</span></span>, whom fails his wintry store,<br>
        And looking out beholds the plain around<br>
        All whiten’d; whence impatiently he smites<br>
        His thighs, and to his hut returning in,<br>
        There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,<br>
        As a discomfited and helpless man;<br>
        Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope<br>
        Spring in his bosom, finding e’en thus soon<br>
        The world hath changed its countenance, grasps his crook,<br>
        And forth to pasture drives his little flock:<br>
        So me my guide dishearten’d, when I saw<br>
        His troubled forehead; and so speedily<br>
        That ill was cured; for at the fallen bridge<br>
        Arriving, toward me with a look as sweet,<br>
        He turn’d him back, as that I first beheld<br>
        At the steep mountain’s foot. Regarding well<br>
        The ruin, and some counsel first maintain’d<br>
        With his own thought, he opened wide his arm<br>
        And took me up. As one, who, while he works,<br>
        Computes his labor’s issue, that he seems<br>
        Still to foresee the effect; so lifting me<br>
        Up to the summit of one peak, he fix’d<br>
        His eye upon another. “Grapple that,”<br>
        Said he, “but first make proof, if it be such<br>
        As will sustain thee.” For one capt with lead<br>
        This were no journey. Scarcely he, though light,<br>
        And I, though onward push’d from crag to crag,<br>
        Could mount. And if the precinct of this coast<br>
        Were not less ample than the last, for him<br>
        I know not, but my strength had surely fail’d.<br>
        But <span class="tooltip">Malebolge<span class="tooltiptext">In Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Malebolge is the eighth circle of Hell. Roughly translated from Italian, it means "evil ditches".</span></span> all toward the mouth<br>
        Inclining of the nethermost abyss,<br>
        The site of every valley hence requires,<br>
        That one side upward slope, the other fall.
      </p>

      <p>
          At length the point from whence the utmost stone<br>
        Juts down, we reach’d; soon as to that arrived,<br>
        So was the breath exhausted from my lungs<br>
        I could no further, but did seat me there.
      </p>

      <p>
          “Now needs thy best of man;” so spake my guide:<br>
        “For not on downy plumes, nor under shade<br>
        Of canopy reposing, fame is won;<br>
        Without which whosoe’r consumes his days,<br>
        Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,<br>
        As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.<br>
        Thou therefore rise: vanquish thy weariness<br>
        By the mind’s effort, in each struggle form’d<br>
        To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight<br>
        Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.<br>
        A longer ladder yet remains to scale.<br>
        From these to have escaped sufficeth not,<br>
        If well thou note me, profit by my words.”
      </p>

      <p>
          I straightway rose, and show’d myself less spent<br>
        That I in truth did feel me. “On,” I cried,<br>
        “For I am stout and fearless.” Up the rock<br>
        Our way we held, more rugged than before,<br>
        Narrower, and steeper far to climb. From talk<br>
        I ceased not, as we journey’d, so to seem<br>
        Least faint; whereat a voice from the other <span class="tooltip">foss<span class="tooltiptext">a moat or defensive ditch in a fortification, usually filled with water.</span></span><br>
        Did issue forth, for utterance suited ill.<br>
        Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,<br>
        What were the words I knew not, but who spake<br>
        Seem’d moved in anger. Down I stoop’d to look;<br>
        But my quick eye might reach not to the depth<br>
        For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:<br>
        “To the next circle, teacher, bend thy steps,<br>
        And from the wall dismount we; for as hence<br>
        I hear and understand not, so I see<br>
        Beneath, and naught discern.” “I answer not,”<br>
        Said he, “but by the deed. To fair request<br>
        Silent performance maketh best return.”
      </p>

      <p>
          We from the bridge’s head descended, where<br>
        To the eighth mound it joins; and then, the chasm<br>
        Opening to view, I saw a crowd within<br>
        Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape<br>
        And hideous, that remembrance in my veins<br>
        Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands<br>
        Let Libya vaunt no more: if Jaculus,<br>
        Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,<br>
        <span class="tooltip">Cenchris and Amphisbæna<span class="tooltiptext">snakes</span></span>, plagues so dire<br>
        Or in such numbers swarming ne’er she show’d,<br>
        Not with all Ethiopia, and whate’er<br>
        Above the Erythræan sea is spawn’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amid this dread exuberance of woe<br>
      Ran naked spirits wing’d with horrid fear,<br>
      Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,<br>
      Or <span class="tooltip">heliotrope<span class="tooltiptext">A plant that turns so that it faces the sun; Particularly, a purple-flowered plant of the species Heliotropium arborescens</span></span> to charm them out of view.<br>
      With serpents were their hands behind them bound,<br>
      Which through their reins infix’d the tail and head,<br>
      Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one<br>
      Near to our side, darted an adder up,<br>
      And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,<br>
      Transpierced him. Far more quickly than e’er pen<br>
      Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn’d, and changed<br>
      To ashes all, pour’d out upon the earth.<br>
      When there dissolved he lay, the dust again<br>
      Uproll’d spontaneous, and the self-same form<br>
      Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell,<br>
      The Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years<br>
      Have well-nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith<br>
      <span class="tooltip">Renascent<span class="tooltiptext">becoming active or popular again.</span></span>: blade nor herb throughout his life<br>
      He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone<br>
      And odorous <span class="tooltip">amomum<span class="tooltiptext">Plants of this genus are remarkable for their pungency and aromatic properties</span></span>: swaths of nard<br>
      And myrrh his funeral shroud. As one that falls,<br>
      He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg’d<br>
      To earth, or through obstruction fettering up<br>
      In chains invisible the powers of man,<br>
      Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,<br>
      Bewilder’d with the monstrous agony<br>
      He hath endured, and wildly staring sighs;<br>
      So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
      </p>

      <p>
          Oh! how severe God’s judgment, that deals out<br>
        Such blows in stormy vengeance. Who he was,<br>
        My teacher next inquired; and thus in few<br>
        He answer’d: “Vanni Fucci am I call’d,<br>
        Not long since rained down from Tuscany<br>
        To this dire gullet. Me the bestial life<br>
        And not the human pleased, mule that I was,<br>
        Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I then to Virgil: “Bid him stir not hence;<br>
      And ask what crime did thrust him thither: once<br>
      A man I knew him, choleric and bloody.”
      </p>

      <p>
          The sinner heard and feign’d not, but toward me<br>
        His mind directing and his face, wherein<br>
        Was dismal shame depictured, thus he spake:<br>
        “It grieves me more to have been caught by thee<br>
        In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than<br>
        When I was taken from the other life.<br>
        I have no power permitted to deny<br>
        What thou inquirest. I am doom’d thus low<br>
        To dwell, for that the sacristy by me<br>
        Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,<br>
        And with the guilt another falsely charged.<br>
        But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,<br>
        So as thou e’er shalt ’scape this darksome realm,<br>
        Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.<br>
        Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines;<br>
        Then Florence changeth citizens and laws;<br>
        From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,<br>
        A vapor rises, wrapt in <span class="tooltip">turbid<span class="tooltiptext">(of a liquid) cloudy, opaque, or thick with suspended matter.</span></span> mists,<br>
        And sharp and eager driveth on the storm<br>
        With Arrowy hurtling o’er Piceno’s field,<br>
        Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike<br>
        Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.<br>
        This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.”
      </p>

      <h2>Canto XXV</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—The sacrilegious Fucci vents his fury in blasphemy, is seized by serpents, and flying is pursued by <span class="tooltip">Cacus<span class="tooltiptext">Cacus is a character in Roman mythology. He was a hideous, three-headed, fire-belching shepherd who lived in a cave in the Aventine Forest in Italy. His cave was covered with the bones of the people he killed.</span></span> in the form of a Centaur, who is described with a swarm of serpents on his haunch, and a dragon on his shoulders breathing forth fire. Our Poet then meets with the spirits of three of his countrymen, two of whom undergo a marvelous transformation in his presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        WHEN he had spoke, the sinner raised his hands<br>
        Pointed in mockery and cried” “Take them, God!<br>
        I level them at thee.” From that day forth<br>
        The serpents were my friends; for round his neck<br>
        One of them rolling twisted, as it said,<br>
        “Be silent, tongue!” Another, to his arms<br>
        Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself<br>
        So close, it took from them the power to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pistoia! ah, Pistoia! why dost doubt<br>
      To turn thee into ashes, cumbering earth<br>
      No longer, since in evil act so far<br>
      Thou hast outdone thy seed? I did not mark,<br>
      Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss,<br>
      Spirit, that swell’d so proudly ’gainst his God;<br>
      Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled,<br>
      Nor utter’d more; and after him there came<br>
      A Centaur full of fury, shouting, “Where,<br>
      Where is the <span class="tooltip">caitiff<span class="tooltiptext">a contemptible or cowardly person.</span></span>?” On Maremma’s marsh<br>
      Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch<br>
      They swarm’d, to where the human face begins.<br>
      Behind his head, upon the shoulders, lay<br>
      With open wings a dragon, breathing fire<br>
      On whomsoe’er he met. To me my guide:<br>
      “Cacus is this, who underneath the rock<br>
      Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.<br>
      He, from his brethren parted, here must tread<br>
      A different journey, for his fraudful theft<br>
      Of the great herd that near him stall’d; whence found<br>
      His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace<br>
      Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on<br>
      A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.”
      </p>

      <p>
        While yet he spake, the Centaur sped away:<br>
      And under us three spirits came, of whom<br>
      Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim’d,<br>
      “Say who are ye!” We then brake off discourse,<br>
      Intent on these alone. I knew them not:<br>
      But, as it chanceth oft, befell that one<br>
      Had need to name another. “Where,” said he,<br>
      “Doth Cianfa lurk?” I, for a sign my guide<br>
      Should stand attentive, placed against my lips<br>
      The finger lifted. If, O reader! now<br>
      Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,<br>
      No marvel; for myself do scarce allow<br>
      The witness of mine eyes. But as I look’d<br>
      Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet<br>
      Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:<br>
      His midmost grasp’d the belly, a forefoot<br>
      Seized on each arm (while deep in either cheek<br>
      He flesh’d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs<br>
      Were spread, ’twixt which the tail inserted curl’d<br>
      Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne’er clasp’d<br>
      A <span class="tooltip">dodder’d<span class="tooltiptext">deprived of branches through age or decay</span></span> oak, as round the other’s limbs<br>
      The hideous monster intertwined his own.<br>
      Then, as they both had been of burning wax,<br>
      Each melted into other, mingling hues,<br>
      That which was either now was seen no more.<br>
      Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,<br>
      A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,<br>
      And the clean white expires. The other two<br>
      Look’d on exclaiming, “Ah! how dost thou change,<br>
      Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,<br>
      Nor only one.” The two heads now became<br>
      One, and two figures blended in one form<br>
      Appear’d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths<br>
      Two arms were made: the belly and the chest,<br>
      The thighs and legs, into such members changed<br>
      As never eye hath seen. Of former shape<br>
      All trace was vanish’d. Two, yet neither, seem’d<br>
      That image miscreate, and so pass’d on<br>
      With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge<br>
      Of the fierce dog-star that lays bare the fields,<br>
      Shifting from brake to brake the lizard seems<br>
      A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road;<br>
      So toward the entrails of the other two<br>
      Approaching seem’d an adder all on fire,<br>
      As the dark pepper-grain livid and <span class="tooltip">swart<span class="tooltiptext">swarthy; of a dark color, complexion, or cast</span></span>.<br>
      In that part, whence our life is nourish’d first,<br>
      Once he transpierced; then down before him fell<br>
      Stretch’d out. The pierced spirit look’d on him,<br>
      But spake not; yea, stood motionless and yawn’d,<br>
      As if by sleep or feverous fit assail’d.<br>
      He eyed the serpent, and the serpent him.<br>
      One from the wound, the other from the mouth<br>
      Breathed a thick smoke, whose vapory columns join’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lucan in mute attention now may hear,<br>
      Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus, tell,<br>
      Nor thine, Nasidius. Ovid now be mute.<br>
      What if in warbling fiction he record<br>
      Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake<br>
      Him changed, and her into a fountain clear,<br>
      I envy not; for never face to face<br>
      Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,<br>
      Wherein both shapes were ready to assume<br>
      The other’s substance. They in mutual guise<br>
      So answer’d that the serpent split his train<br>
      Divided to a fork, and the pierced spirit<br>
      Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs<br>
      Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon<br>
      Was visible: the tail, disparted, took<br>
      The figure which the spirit lost; its skin<br>
      Softening, his <span class="tooltip">indurated<span class="tooltiptext">hardened</span></span> to a rind.<br>
      The shoulders next I mark’d, that entering join’d<br>
      The monster’s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet<br>
      So lengthen’d, as the others dwindling shrunk.<br>
      The feet behind then twisting up became<br>
      That part that man conceals, which in the wretch<br>
      Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke<br>
      With a new color veils, and generates<br>
      The <span class="tooltip">excrescent<span class="tooltiptext">forming an abnormal, excessive, or useless outgrowth</span></span> pile on one, peeling it off<br>
      From the other body, lo! upon his feet<br>
      One upright rose, and prone the other fell.<br>
      Nor yet their glaring and malignant lamps<br>
      Were shifted, though each feature changed beneath.<br>
      Of him who stood erect, the mounting face<br>
      Retreated toward the temples, and what there<br>
      Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears<br>
      From the smooth cheeks; the rest, not backward dragg’d,<br>
      Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell’d<br>
      Into due size protuberant the lips.<br>
      He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends<br>
      His sharpen’d visage, and draws down the ears<br>
      Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.<br>
      His tongue, continuous before and apt<br>
      For utterance, severs; and the other’s fork<br>
      Closing unites. That done, the smoke was laid.<br>
      The soul, transform’d into the brute, glides off,<br>
      Hissing along the vale, and after him<br>
      The other talking sputters; but soon turn’d<br>
      His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few<br>
      Thus to another spake: “Along this path<br>
      Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        So saw I fluctuate in successive change<br>
      The unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:<br>
      And here if aught my pen have swerved, events<br>
      So strange may be its warrant. O’er mine eyes<br>
      Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet ’scaped they not so covertly, but well<br>
      I mark’d Sciancato: he alone it was<br>
      Of the three first that came, who changed not: tho’<br>
      The other’s fate, Gaville! still dost rue.
