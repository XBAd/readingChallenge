      <h2>The Chambered Nautilus</h2>

      <p>
        THIS is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign, <br>
                Sails the unshadowed main,—<br>
                The venturous bark that flings<br>
            On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings<br>
            In gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings,<br>
                And coral reefs lie bare,<br>
        Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;<br>
            Wrecked is the ship of pearl!<br>
            And every chambered cell,<br>
        Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,<br>
            As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,<br>
            Before thee lies revealed,—<br>
    Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!
      </p>

      <p>
        Year after year beheld the silent toil<br>
            That spread his lustrous coil;<br>
            Still, as the spiral grew,<br>
        He left the past year’s dwelling for the new,<br>
            Stole with soft step its shining archway through,<br>
            Built up its idle door,<br>
    Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,<br>
            Child of the wandering sea,<br>
            Cast from her lap, forlorn!<br>
        From thy dead lips a clearer note is born<br>
            Than ever Triton blew from wreathèd horn!<br>
            While on mine ear it rings,<br>
    Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—
      </p>

      <p>
        Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,<br>
            As the swift seasons roll!<br>
            Leave thy low-vaulted past!<br>
        Let each new temple, nobler than the last,<br>
            Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,<br>
            Till thou at length art free,<br>
    Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea!
      </p>

      <h2>Old Ironsides</h2>

      <p>
        AY, 1 tear her tattered ensign down!<br>
          Long has it waved on high,<br>
        And many an eye has danced to see<br>
          That banner in the sky;<br>
        Beneath it rung the battle shout,<br>
          And burst the cannon’s roar;—<br>
        The meteor of the ocean air<br>
          Shall sweep the clouds no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her deck once red with heroes’ blood,<br>
          Where knelt the vanquished foe,<br>
        When winds were hurrying o’er the flood<br>
          And waves were white below,<br>
        No more shall feel the victor’s tread,<br>
          Or know the conquered knee;—<br>
        The harpies of the shore shall pluck<br>
          The eagle of the sea!
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, better that her shattered hulk<br>
          Should sink beneath the wave;<br>
        Her thunders shook the mighty deep,<br>
          And there should be her grave:<br>
        Nail to the mast her holy flag,<br>
          Set every threadbare sail,<br>
        And give her to the god of storms,<br>
          The lightning and the gale!
      </p>

      <h2>The Last Leaf</h2>

      <p>
        I SAW him once before,<br>
        As he passed by the door;<br>
              And again<br>
        The pavement stones resound,<br>
        As he totters o’er the ground<br>
              With his cane.
      </p>

      <p>
        They say that in his prime,<br>
        Ere the pruning-knife of Time<br>
              Cut him down,<br>
        Not a better man was found<br>
        By the Crier on his round<br>
              Through the town.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now he walks the streets,<br>
        And he looks at all he meets<br>
              Sad and wan;<br>
        And shakes his feeble head,<br>
        That it seems as if he said,<br>
              “They are gone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The mossy marbles rest<br>
        On the lips that he has prest<br>
              In their bloom;<br>
        And the names he loved to hear<br>
        Have been carved for many a year<br>
              On the tomb.
      </p>

      <p>
        My grandmamma has said—<br>
        Poor old lady, she is dead<br>
              Long ago—<br>
        That he had a Roman nose,<br>
        And his cheek was like a rose<br>
              In the snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now his nose is thin,<br>
        And it rests upon his chin<br>
              Like a staff;<br>
        And a crook is in his back,<br>
        And a melancholy crack<br>
              In his laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know it is a sin<br>
        For me to sit and grin<br>
              At him here;<br>
        But the old three-cornered hat,<br>
        And the breeches and all that,<br>
              Are so queer!
      </p>

      <p>
        And if I should live to be<br>
        The last leaf upon the tree<br>
              In the spring,<br>
        Let them smile, as I do now,<br>
        At the old forsaken bough<br>
              Where I cling.
