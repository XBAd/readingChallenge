          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Sr." target="_blank"><em>Oliver Wendell Holmes</em></a>
          (August 29, 1809 – October 7, 1894) was an American physician, poet,
          and polymath based in Boston. A member of the Fireside Poets,
          he was acclaimed by his peers as one of the best writers of the day.
          In addition to his work as an author and poet, Holmes also served
          as a physician, professor, lecturer and inventor and, although he
          never practiced it, he received formal training in law.
          Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Holmes was educated at Phillips Academy
          and Harvard College. He began writing poetry at an early age; one of
          his most famous works, "Old Ironsides", was published in 1830 and was
          influential in the eventual preservation of the USS Constitution.
          Surrounded by Boston's literary elite—which included friends such as
          Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell
          Lowell—Holmes made an indelible imprint on the literary world of the
          19th century. Many of his works were published in <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>,
          a magazine that he named.

      <h2>The Chambered Nautilus</h2>

      <p>
        THIS is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign, <br>
                Sails the unshadowed main,—<br>
                The venturous bark that flings<br>
            On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings<br>
            In gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings,<br>
                And coral reefs lie bare,<br>
        Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;<br>
            Wrecked is the ship of pearl!<br>
            And every chambered cell,<br>
        Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,<br>
            As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,<br>
            Before thee lies revealed,—<br>
    Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!
      </p>

      <p>
        Year after year beheld the silent toil<br>
            That spread his lustrous coil;<br>
            Still, as the spiral grew,<br>
        He left the past year’s dwelling for the new,<br>
            Stole with soft step its shining archway through,<br>
            Built up its idle door,<br>
    Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,<br>
            Child of the wandering sea,<br>
            Cast from her lap, forlorn!<br>
        From thy dead lips a clearer note is born<br>
            Than ever <span class="tooltip">Triton<span class="tooltiptext">a Greek god of the sea, the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea respectively</span></span> blew from wreathèd horn!<br>
            While on mine ear it rings,<br>
    Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—
      </p>

      <p>
        Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,<br>
            As the swift seasons roll!<br>
            Leave thy low-vaulted past!<br>
        Let each new temple, nobler than the last,<br>
            Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,<br>
            Till thou at length art free,<br>
    Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea!
      </p>

      <h2>Old Ironsides</h2>

      <p>
        AY, tear her tattered <span class="tooltip">ensign<span class="tooltiptext">a flag or standard, especially a military or naval one indicating nationality.</span></span> down!<br>
          Long has it waved on high,<br>
        And many an eye has danced to see<br>
          That banner in the sky;<br>
        Beneath it rung the battle shout,<br>
          And burst the cannon’s roar;—<br>
        The meteor of the ocean air<br>
          Shall sweep the clouds no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her deck once red with heroes’ blood,<br>
          Where knelt the vanquished foe,<br>
        When winds were hurrying o’er the flood<br>
          And waves were white below,<br>
        No more shall feel the victor’s tread,<br>
          Or know the conquered knee;—<br>
        The <span class="tooltip">harpies<span class="tooltiptext">In Greek mythology and Roman mythology, a rapacious monster described as having a woman's head and body and a bird's wings and claws or depicted as a bird of prey with a woman's face; a grasping, unpleasant woman.</span></span> of the shore shall pluck<br>
          The eagle of the sea!
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, better that her shattered hulk<br>
          Should sink beneath the wave;<br>
        Her thunders shook the mighty deep,<br>
          And there should be her grave:<br>
        Nail to the mast her holy flag,<br>
          Set every threadbare sail,<br>
        And give her to the god of storms,<br>
          The lightning and the gale!
      </p>

      <h2>The Last Leaf</h2>

      <p>
        I SAW him once before,<br>
        As he passed by the door;<br>
              And again<br>
        The pavement stones resound,<br>
        As he totters o’er the ground<br>
              With his cane.
      </p>

      <p>
        They say that in his prime,<br>
        Ere the pruning-knife of Time<br>
              Cut him down,<br>
        Not a better man was found<br>
        By the Crier on his round<br>
              Through the town.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now he walks the streets,<br>
        And he looks at all he meets<br>
              Sad and <span class="tooltip">wan<span class="tooltiptext">(of a person's complexion or appearance) pale and giving the impression of illness or exhaustion.</span></span>;<br>
        And shakes his feeble head,<br>
        That it seems as if he said,<br>
              “They are gone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The mossy marbles rest<br>
        On the lips that he has prest<br>
              In their bloom;<br>
        And the names he loved to hear<br>
        Have been carved for many a year<br>
              On the tomb.
      </p>

      <p>
        My grandmamma has said—<br>
        Poor old lady, she is dead<br>
              Long ago—<br>
        That he had a Roman nose,<br>
        And his cheek was like a rose<br>
              In the snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now his nose is thin,<br>
        And it rests upon his chin<br>
              Like a staff;<br>
        And a crook is in his back,<br>
        And a melancholy crack<br>
              In his laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know it is a sin<br>
        For me to sit and grin<br>
              At him here;<br>
        But the old three-cornered hat,<br>
        And the breeches and all that,<br>
              Are so queer!
      </p>

      <p>
        And if I should live to be<br>
        The last leaf upon the tree<br>
              In the spring,<br>
        Let them smile, as I do now,<br>
        At the old forsaken bough<br>
              Where I cling.
