      <h2>Maud Muller</h2>

      <p>
        MAUD MULLER on a summer’s day <br>
        Raked the meadow sweet with hay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth <br>
        Of simple beauty and rustic health.
      </p>

      <p>
        Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee<br>
        The mock-bird echoed from his tree.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when she glanced to the far-off town,<br>
        White from its hill-slope looking down,
      </p>

      <p>
        The sweet song died, and a vague unrest<br>
        And a nameless longing filled her breast,—
      </p>

      <p>
        A wish that she hardly dared to own,<br>
        For something better than she had known.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Judge rode slowly down the lane,<br>
        Smoothing his horse’s chestnut mane.
      </p>

      <p>
        He drew his bridle in the shade<br>
        Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,
      </p>

      <p>
        And asked a draught from the spring that flowed<br>
        Through the meadow across the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up,<br>
        And filled for him her small tin cup,
      </p>

      <p>
        And blushed as she gave it, looking down<br>
        On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Thanks!’ said the Judge; ‘a sweeter draught<br>
        From a fairer hand was never quaffed.’
      </p>

      <p>
        He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,<br>
        Of the singing birds and the humming bees;
      </p>

      <p>
        Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether<br>
        The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown,<br>
        And her graceful ankles bare and brown;
      </p>

      <p>
        And listened, while a pleased surprise<br>
        Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        At last, like one who for delay<br>
        Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maud Muller looked and sighed: ‘Ah me!<br>
        That I the Judge’s bride might be!
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘He would dress me up in silks so fine,<br>
        And praise and toast me at his wine.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘My father should wear a broadcloth coat;<br>
        My brother should sail a painted boat.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘I’d dress my mother so grand and gay,<br>
        And the baby should have a new toy each day.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘And I’d feed the hungry and clothe the poor,<br>
        And all should bless me who left our door.’
      </p>

      <p>
        The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill<br>
        And saw Maud Muller standing still.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘A form more fair, a face more sweet,<br>
        Ne’er hath it been my lot to meet.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘And her modest answer and graceful air<br>
        Show her wise and good as she is fair.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Would she were mine, and I to-day,<br>
        Like her, a harvester of hay;
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,<br>
        Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘But low of cattle and song of birds,<br>
        And health and quiet and loving words.’
      </p>

      <p>
        But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,<br>
        And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,<br>
        And Maud was left in the field alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,<br>
        When he hummed in court an old love-tune;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the young girl mused beside the well<br>
        Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wedded a wife of richest dower,<br>
        Who lived for fashion, as he for power.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet oft, in his marble hearth’s bright glow,<br>
        He watched a picture come and go;
      </p>

      <p>
        And sweet Maud Muller’s hazel eyes<br>
        Looked out in their innocent surprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oft, when the wine in his glass was red,<br>
        He longed for the wayside well instead;
      </p>

      <p>
        And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms<br>
        To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain,<br>
        ‘Ah, that I were free again!
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Free as when I rode that day,<br>
        Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay.’
      </p>

      <p>
        She wedded a man unlearned and poor,<br>
        And many children played round her door.
      </p>

      <p>
        But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain,<br>
        Left their traces on heart and brain.
      </p>

      <p>
        And oft, when the summer sun shone hot<br>
        On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,
      </p>

      <p>
        And she heard the little spring brook fall<br>
        Over the roadside, through the wall,
      </p>

      <p>
        In the shade of the apple-tree again<br>
        She saw a rider draw his rein;
      </p>

      <p>
        And, gazing down with timid grace,<br>
        She felt his pleased eyes read her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls<br>
        Stretched away into stately halls;
      </p>

      <p>
        The weary wheel to a spinnet turned,<br>
        The tallow candle an astral burned,
      </p>

      <p>
        And for him who sat by the chimney lug,<br>
        Dozing and grumbling o’er pipe and mug,
      </p>

      <p>
        A manly form at her side she saw,<br>
        And joy was duty and love was law.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then she took up her burden of life again,<br>
        Saying only, ‘It might have been.’
      </p>

      <p>
        Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,<br>
        For rich repiner and household drudge!
      </p>

      <p>
        God pity them both! and pity us all,<br>
        Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.
      </p>

      <p>
        For of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br>
        The saddest are these: ‘It might have been!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies<br>
        Deeply buried from human eyes;
      </p>

      <p>
        And, in the hereafter, angels may<br>
        Roll the stone from its grave away!
      </p>

      <h2>The Barefoot Boy</h2>

      <p>
        BLESSINGS on thee, little man,<br>
        Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!<br>
        With thy turned-up pantaloons,<br>
        And thy merry whistled tunes;<br>
        With thy red lip, redder still<br>
        Kissed by strawberries on the hill;<br>
        With the sunshine on thy face,<br>
        Through thy torn brim’s jaunty grace;<br>
        From my heart I give thee joy,—<br>
        I was once a barefoot boy!<br>
        Prince thou art,—the grown-up man<br>
        Only is republican.<br>
        Let the million-dollared ride!<br>
        Barefoot, trudging at his side,<br>
        Thou hast more than he can buy<br>
        In the reach of ear and eye,—<br>
        Outward sunshine, inward joy:<br>
        Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh for boyhood’s painless play,<br>
        Sleep that wakes in laughing day,<br>
        Health that mocks the doctor’s rules,<br>
        Knowledge never learned of schools,<br>
        Of the wild bee’s morning chase,<br>
        Of the wild-flower’s time and place,<br>
        Flight of fowl and habitude<br>
        Of the tenants of the wood;<br>
        How the tortoise bears his shell,<br>
        How the woodchuck digs his cell,<br>
        And the ground-mole sinks his well;<br>
        How the robin feeds her young,<br>
        How the oriole’s nest is hung;<br>
        Where the whitest lilies blow,<br>
        Where the freshest berries grow,<br>
        Where the ground-nut trails its vine,<br>
        Where the wood-grape’s clusters shine;<br>
        Of the black wasp’s cunning way,<br>
        Mason of his walls of clay,<br>
        And the architectural plans<br>
        Of gray hornet artisans!<br>
        For, eschewing books and tasks,<br>
        Nature answers all he asks;<br>
        Hand in hand with her he walks,<br>
        Face to face with her he talks,<br>
        Part and parcel of her joy,—<br>
        Blessings on the barefoot boy!
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh for boyhood’s time of June,<br>
        Crowding years in one brief moon,<br>
        When all things I heard or saw,<br>
        Me, their master, waited for.<br>
        I was rich in flowers and trees,<br>
        Humming-birds and honey-bees;<br>
        For my sport the squirrel played,<br>
        Plied the snouted mole his spade;<br>
        For my taste the blackberry cone<br>
        Purpled over hedge and stone;<br>
        Laughed the brook for my delight<br>
        Through the day and through the night,<br>
        Whispering at the garden wall,<br>
        Talked with me from fall to fall;<br>
        Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,<br>
        Mine the walnut slopes beyond,<br>
        Mine, on bending orchard trees,<br>
        Apples of Hesperides!<br>
        Still as my horizon grew,<br>
        Larger grew my riches too;<br>
        All the world I saw or knew<br>
        Seemed a complex Chinese toy,<br>
        Fashioned for a barefoot boy!<br>
        Oh for festal dainties spread,<br>
        Like my bowl of milk and bread;<br>
        Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,<br>
        On the door-stone, gray and rude!<br>
        O’er me, like a regal tent,<br>
        Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,<br>
        Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,<br>
        Looped in many a wind-swung fold;<br>
        While for music came the play<br>
        Of the pied frogs’ orchestra;<br>
        And, to light the noisy choir,<br>
        Lit the fly his lamp of fire.<br>
        I was monarch: pomp and joy<br>
        Waited on the barefoot boy!
      </p>

      <p>
        Cheerily, then, my little man,<br>
        Live and laugh, as boyhood can!<br>
        Though the flinty slopes be hard,<br>
        Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,<br>
        Every morn shall lead thee through<br>
        Fresh baptisms of the dew;<br>
        Every evening from thy feet<br>
        Shall the cool wind kiss the heat:<br>
        All too soon these feet must hide<br>
        In the prison cells of pride,<br>
        Lose the freedom of the sod,<br>
        Like a colt’s for work be shod,<br>
        Made to treat the mills of toil,<br>
        Up and down in ceaseless moil:<br>
        Happy if their track be found<br>
        Never on forbidden ground;<br>
        Happy if they sink not in<br>
        Quick and treacherous sands of sin.<br>
        Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,<br>
        Ere it passes, barefoot boy!
      </p>

      <h2>Skipper Ireson’s Ride</h2>

      <p>
        OF all the rides since the birth of time,<br>
        Told in story or sung in rhyme,—<br>
        On Apuleius’s Golden Ass,<br>
        Or one-eyed Calender’s horse of brass,<br>
        Witch astride of a human back,<br>
        Islam’s prophet on Al-Borák,—<br>
        The strangest ride that ever was sped<br>
        Was Ireson’s, out from Marblehead!<br>
          Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,<br>
          Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart<br>
            By the women of Marblehead!
      </p>

      <p>
        Body of turkey, head of owl,<br>
        Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl,<br>
        Feathered and ruffled in every part,<br>
        Skipper Ireson stood in the cart.<br>
        Scores of women, old and young,<br>
        Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue,<br>
        Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane,<br>
        Shouting and singing the shrill refrain:<br>
          ’Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,<br>
          Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt<br>
            By the women o’ Morble’ead!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips,<br>
        Girls in bloom of cheek and lips,<br>
        Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase<br>
        Bacchus round some antique vase,<br>
        Brief of skirt, with ankles bare,<br>
        Loose of kerchief and loose of hair,<br>
        With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns’ twang,<br>
        Over and over the Maenads sang:<br>
          ’Here’s Flud Orison, fur his horrd horrt,<br>
          Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt<br>
            By the women o’ Morble’ead!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Small pity for him!—He sailed away<br>
        From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay,—<br>
        Sailed away from a sinking wreck,<br>
        With his own town’s-people on her deck!<br>
        ’Lay by! lay by!’ they called to him.<br>
        Back he answered, ’Sink or swim!<br>
        Brag of your catch of fish again!’<br>
        And off hée sailed through the fog and rain!<br>
          Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,<br>
          Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart<br>
            By the women of Marblehead!
      </p>

      <p>
        Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur<br>
        That wreck shall lie forevermore.<br>
        Mother and sister, wife and maid,<br>
        Looked from the rocks of Marblehead<br>
        Over the moaning and rainy sea,—<br>
        Looked for the coming that might not be!<br>
        What did the winds and the sea-birds say<br>
        Of the cruel captain who sailed away?<br>
          Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,<br>
          Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart<br>
            By the women of Marblehead!
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the street, on either side,<br>
        Up flew windows, doors swung wide;<br>
        Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray,<br>
        Treble lent the fish-horn’s bray.<br>
        Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound,<br>
        Hulks of old sailors run aground,<br>
        Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane,<br>
        And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain:<br>
          ’Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,<br>
          Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt<br>
            By the women o’ Morble’ead!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Sweetly along the Salem road<br>
        Bloom of orchard and lilac showed.<br>
        Little the wicked skipper knew<br>
        Of the fields so green and the sky so blue.<br>
        Riding there in his sorry trim,<br>
        Like an Indian idol glum and grim,<br>
        Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear<br>
        Of voices shouting, far and near:<br>
          ’Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,<br>
          Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt<br>
            By the women o’ Morble’ead!’
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Hear me, neighbors!’ at last he cried,—<br>
        ’What to me is this noisy ride?<br>
        What is the shame that clothes the skin<br>
        To the nameless horror that lives within?<br>
        Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck,<br>
        And hear a cry from a reeling deck!<br>
        Hate me and curse me,—I only dread<br>
        The hand of God and the face of the dead!’<br>
          Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,<br>
          Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart<br>
            By the women of Marblehead!
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea<br>
        Said, ’God has touched him! Why should we!’<br>
        Said an old wife mourning her only son,<br>
        ’Cut the rogue’s tether and let him run!’<br>
        So with soft relentings and rude excuse,<br>
        Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose,<br>
        And gave him a cloak to hide him in,<br>
        And left him alone with his shame and sin.<br>
          Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,<br>
          Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart<br>
            By the women of Marblehead!
      </p>

      <h2>The Pipes at Lucknow</h2>

      <p>
        PIPES of the misty moorlands,<br>
          Voice of the glens and hills;<br>
        The droning of the torrents,<br>
          The treble of the rills!<br>
        Not the braes of bloom and heather,<br>
          Nor the mountains dark with rain,<br>
        Nor maiden bower, nor border tower,<br>
          Have heard your sweetest strain!
      </p>

      <p>
        Dear to the Lowland reaper,<br>
          And plaided mountaineer,—<br>
        To the cottage and the castle<br>
          The Scottish pipes and dear;—<br>
        Sweet sounds the ancient pibroch<br>
          O’er mountain, loch, and glade;<br>
        But the sweetest of all music<br>
          The pipes at Lucknow played.
      </p>

      <p>
        Day by day the Indian tiger<br>
          Louder yelled, and nearer crept;<br>
        Round and round the jungle-serpent<br>
          Near and nearer circles swept.<br>
        ‘Pray for rescue, wives and mothers,—<br>
          Pray to-day!’ the soldier said;<br>
        ‘To-morrow, death’s between us<br>
          And the wrong and shame we dread.’
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, they listened, looked, and waited,<br>
          Till their hope became despair;<br>
        And the sobs of low bewailing<br>
          Filled the pauses of their prayer.<br>
        Then up spake a Scottish maiden,<br>
          With her ear unto the ground:<br>
        ‘Dinna ye hear it?—dinna ye hear it?<br>
          The pipes o’ Havelock sound!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Hushed the wounded man his groaning;<br>
          Hushed the wife her little ones;<br>
        Alone they heard the drum-roll<br>
          And the roar of Sepoy guns.<br>
        But to sounds of home and childhood<br>
          The Highland ear was true;—<br>
        As her mother’s cradle-crooning<br>
          The mountain pipes she knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like the march of soundless music<br>
          Through the vision of the seer,<br>
        More of feeling than of hearing,<br>
          Of the heart than of the ear,<br>
        She knew the droning pibroch,<br>
          She knew the Campbell’s call:<br>
        ‘Hark! hear ye no MacGregor’s,<br>
          The grandest o’ them all!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, they listened, dumb and breathless,<br>
          And they caught the sound at last;<br>
        Faint and far beyond the Goomtee<br>
          Rose and fell the piper’s blast!<br>
        Then a burst of wild thanksgiving<br>
          Mingled woman’s voice and man’s;<br>
        ‘God be praised!—the march of Havelock!<br>
          The piping of the clans!’
      </p>

      <p>
        Louder, nearer, fierce as vengeance,<br>
          Sharp and shrill as swords at strife,<br>
        Came the wild MacGregor’s clan-call,<br>
          Stinging all the air to life.<br>
        But when the far-off dust-cloud<br>
          To plaided legions grew,<br>
        Full tenderly and blithesomely<br>
          The pipes of rescue blew!
      </p>

      <p>
        Round the silver domes of Lucknow,<br>
          Moslem mosque and Pagan shrine,<br>
        Breathed the air to Britons dearest,<br>
          The air of Auld Lang Syne.<br>
        O’er the cruel roll of war-drums<br>
          Rose that sweet and homelike strain;<br>
        And the tartan clove the turban,<br>
          As the Goomtee cleaves the plain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dear to the corn-land reaper<br>
          And plaided mountaineer,—<br>
        To the cottage and the castle<br>
          The piper’s song is dear.<br>
        Sweet sounds the Gaelic pibroch<br>
          O’er mountain, glen, and glade;<br>
        But the sweetest of all music<br>
          The pipes at Lucknow played!
      </p>

      <h2>Barbara Frietchie</h2>

      <p>
        The clustered spires of Frederick stand<br>
        Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.
      </p>

      <p>
        Round about them orchards sweep,<br>
        Apple and peach tree fruited deep,
      </p>

      <p>
        Fair as the garden of the Lord<br>
        To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,
      </p>

      <p>
        On that pleasant morn of the early fall<br>
        When Lee marched over the mountain-wall;
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the mountains winding down,<br>
        Horse and foot, into Frederick town.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forty flags with their silver stars,<br>
        Forty flags with their crimson bars,
      </p>

      <p>
        Flapped in the morning wind: the sun<br>
        Of noon looked down, and saw not one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,<br>
        Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
      </p>

      <p>
        Bravest of all in Frederick town,<br>
        She took up the flag the men hauled down;
      </p>

      <p>
        In her attic window the staff she set,<br>
        To show that one heart was loyal yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up the street came the rebel tread,<br>
        Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under his slouched hat left and right<br>
        He glanced; the old flag met his sight
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Halt!’—the dust-brown ranks stood fast.<br>
        ‘Fire!’—out blazed the rifle-blast.
      </p>

      <p>
        It shivered the window, pane and sash;<br>
        It rent the banner with seam and gash.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff<br>
        Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf.
      </p>

      <p>
        She leaned far out on the window-sill,<br>
        And shook it forth with a royal will.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,<br>
        But spare your country’s flag,’ she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,<br>
        Over the face of the leader came;
      </p>

      <p>
        The nobler nature within him stirred<br>
        To life at that woman’s deed and word;
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Who touches a hair of yon gray head<br>
        Dies like a dog! March on!’ he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        All day long through Frederick street<br>
        Sounded the tread of marching feet:
      </p>

      <p>
        All day long that free flag tost<br>
        Over the heads of the rebel host.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever its torn folds rose and fell<br>
        On the loyal winds that loved it well;
      </p>

      <p>
        And through the hill-gaps sunset light<br>
        Shone over it with a warm good-night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,<br>
        And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Honor to her! and let a tear<br>
        Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave,<br>
        Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!
      </p>

      <p>
        Peace and order and beauty draw<br>
        Round thy symbol of light and law;
      </p>

      <p>
        And ever the stars above look down<br>
        On thy stars below in Frederick town!
