      <h2>I</h2>

      <p>
        I THOUGHT once how Theocritus had sung <br>
        Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,<br>
        Who each one in a gracious hand appears<br>
        To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:<br>
        And, as I mused it in its antique tongue,<br>
        I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,<br>
        The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,<br>
        Those of my own life, who by turns had flung<br>
        A shadow across me. Straightway I was ’ware,<br>
        So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move<br>
        Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair<br>;
        And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,—<br>
        “Guess now who holds thee?”—“Death,” I said. But, there,<br>
        The silver answer rang,—“Not Death, but Love.”
      </p>

      <h2>
        II
      </h2>

      <p>
        BUT only three in all God’s universe<br>
        Have heard this word thou hast said,—Himself, beside<br>
        Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied<br>
        One of us … that was God, … and laid the curse<br>
        So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce<br>
        My sight from seeing thee,—that if I had died,<br>
        The deathweights, placed there, would have signified<br>
        Less absolute exclusion. “Nay” is worse<br>
        From God than from all others, O my friend!<br>
        Men could not part us with their worldly jars,<br>
        Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;<br>
        Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:<br>
        And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,<br>
        We should but vow the faster for the stars.
      </p>

      <h2>
        III
      </h2>

      <p>
        UNLIKE are we, unlike, O princely Heart!<br>
        Unlike our uses and our destinies.<br>
        Our ministering two angels look surprise<br>
        On one another, as they strike athwart<br>
        Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink thee, art<br>
        A guest for queens to social pageantries,<br>
        With gages from a hundred brighter eyes<br>
        Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part<br>
        Of chief musician. What hast thou to do<br>
        With looking from the lattice-lights at me,<br>
        A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through<br>
        The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?<br>
        The chrism is on thine head,—on mine, the dew,—<br>
        And Death must dig the level where these agree.
      </p>

      <h2>
        IV
      </h2>

      <p>
        THOU hast thy calling to some palace-floor,<br>
        Most gracious singer of high poems! where<br>
        The dancers will break footing, from the care<br>
        Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.<br>
        And dost thou lift this house’s latch too poor<br>
        For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear<br>
        To let thy music drop here unaware<br>
        In folds of golden fulness at my door?<br>
        Look up and see the casement broken in,<br>
        The bats and owlets builders in the roof!<br>
        My cricket chirps against thy mandolin.<br>
        Hush, call no echo up in further proof<br>
        Of desolation! there’s a voice within<br>
        That weeps … as thou must sing … alone, aloof.
      </p>

      <h2>V</h2>

      <p>
        I LIFT my heavy heart up solemnly,<br>
        As once Electra her sepulchral urn,<br>
        And looking in thine eyes, I overturn<br>
        The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see<br>
        What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,<br>
        And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn<br>
        Through the ashen grayness. If thy foot in scorn<br>
        Could tread them out to darkness utterly,<br>
        It might be well perhaps. But if instead<br>
        Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow<br>
        The gray dust up, … those laurels on thine head,<br>
        O my Belovèd, will not shield thee so,<br>
        That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred<br>
        The hair beneath. Stand farther off then! go.
      </p>

      <h2>VI</h2>

      <p>
        GO from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand<br>
        Hence forward in thy shadow. Nevermore<br>
        Alone upon the threshold of my door<br>
        Of individual life, I shall command<br>
        The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand<br>
        Serenely in the sunshine as before,<br>
        Without the sense of that which I forbore—<br>
        Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land<br>
        Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine<br>
        With pulses that beat double. What I do<br>
        And what I dream include thee, as the wine<br>
        Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue<br>
        God for myself, He hears that name of thine,<br>
        And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
      </p>

      <h2>VII</h2>

      <p>
        THE FACE of all the world is changed, I think,<br>
        Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul<br>
        Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole<br>
        Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink<br>
        Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,<br>
        Was caught up into love, and taught the whole<br>
        Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole<br>
        God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,<br>
        And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.<br>
        The names of country, heaven, are changed away<br>
        For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;<br>
        And this … this lute and song … loved yesterday,<br>
        (The singing angels know) are only dear<br>
        Because thy name moves right in what they say.
      </p>

      <h2>VIII</h2>

      <p>
        WHAT can I give thee back, O liberal<br>
        And princely giver, who hast brought the gold<br>
        And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,<br>
        And laid them on the outside of the wall<br>
        For such as I to take or leave withal,<br>
        In unexpected largesse? am I cold,<br>
        Ungrateful, that for these most manifold<br>
        High gifts, I render nothing back at all?<br>
        Not so; not cold,—but very poor instead.<br>
        Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run<br>
        The colors from my life, and left so dead<br>
        And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done<br>
        To give the same as pillow to thy head.<br>
        Go farther! let it serve to trample on.
      </p>

      <h2>IX</h2>

      <p>
        CAN it be right to give what I can give?<br>
       To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears<br>
       As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years<br>
       Re-sighing on my lips renunciative<br>
       Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live<br>
       For all thy adjurations? O my fears,<br>
       That this can scarce be right! We are not peers,<br>
       So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,<br>
       That givers of such gifts as mine are, must<br>
       Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas!<br>
       I will not soil thy purple with my dust,<br>
       Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,<br>
       Nor give thee any love—which were unjust.<br>
       Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.
      </p>

      <h2>X</h2>

      <p>
        YET, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed<br>
        And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,<br>
        Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light<br>
        Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:<br>
        And love is fire. And when I say at need<br>
        I love thee … mark! … I love thee—in thy sight<br>
        I stand transfigured, glorified aright,<br>
        With conscience of the new rays that proceed<br>
        Out of my face toward thine. There’s nothing low<br>
        In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures<br>
        Who love God, God accepts while loving so.<br>
        And what I feel, across the inferior features<br>
        Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show<br>
        How that great work of Love enhances Nature’s.
      </p>

      <h2>XI</h2>

      <p>
        AND therefore if to love can be desert,<br>
        I am not all unworthy. Cheeks as pale<br>
        As these you see, and trembling knees that fail<br>
        To bear the burden of a heavy heart,—<br>
        This weary minstrel-life that once was girt<br>
        To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail<br>
        To pipe now ’gainst the valley nightingale<br>
        A melancholy music,—why advert<br>
        To these things? O Belovèd, it is plain<br>
        I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!<br>
        And yet, because I love thee, I obtain<br>
        From that same love this vindicating grace,<br>
        To live on still in love, and yet in vain,—<br>
        To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.
      </p>

      <h2>XII</h2>

      <p>
        INDEED this very love which is my boast,<br>
        And which, when rising up from breast to brow,<br>
        Doth crown me with a ruby large enow<br>
        To draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost,—<br>
        This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,<br>
        I should not love withal, unless that thou<br>
        Hadst set me an example, shown me how,<br>
        When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,<br>
        And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak<br>
        Of love even, as a good thing of my own:<br>
        Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,<br>
        And placed it by thee on a golden throne,—<br>
        And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)<br>
        Is by thee only, whom I love alone.
      </p>

      <h2>XIII</h2>

      <p>
        AND wilt thou have me fashion into speech<br>
        The love I bear thee, finding words enough,<br>
        And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,<br>
        Between our faces, to cast light on each?<br>
        I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach<br>
        My hand to hold my spirit so far off<br>
        From myself—me—that I should bring thee proof<br>
        In words, of love hid in me out of reach.<br>
        Nay, let the silence of my womanhood<br>
        Commend my woman-love to thy belief,—<br>
        Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,<br>
        And rend the garment of my life, in brief,<br>
        By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,<br>
        Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.
      </p>

      <h2>XIV</h2>

      <p>
        IF thou must love me, let it be for nought<br>
        Except for love’s sake only. Do not say<br>
        “I love her for her smile—her look—her way<br>
        Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought<br>
        That falls in well with mine, and certes brought<br>
        A sense of pleasant ease on such a day”—<br>
        For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may<br>
        Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,<br>
        May be unwrought so. Neither love me for<br>
        Thine own dear pity’s wiping my cheeks dry,—<br>
        A creature might forget to weep, who bore<br>
        Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!<br>
        But love me for love’s sake, that evermore<br>
        Thou mayst love on, through love’s eternity.<br>
      </p>

      <h2>XV</h2>

      <p>
        ACCUSE me not, beseech thee, that I wear<br>
        Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;<br>
        For we two look two ways, and cannot shine<br>
        With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.<br>
        On me thou lookest with no doubting care,<br>
        As on a bee shut in a crystalline;<br>
        Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love’s divine,<br>
        And to spread wing and fly in the outer air<br>
        Were most impossible failure, if I strove<br>
        To fail so. But I look on thee—on thee—<br>
        Beholding, besides love, the end of love,<br>
        Hearing oblivion beyond memory;<br>
        As one who sits and gazes from above,<br>
        Over the rivers to the bitter sea.
      </p>

      <h2>XVI</h2>

      <p>
        AND yet, because thou overcomest so,<br>
        Because thou art more noble and like a king,<br>
        Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling<br>
        Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow<br>
        Too close against thine heart henceforth to know<br>
        How it shook when alone. Why, conquering<br>
        May prove as lordly and complete a thing<br>
        In lifting upward, as in crushing low!<br>
        And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword<br>
        To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,<br>
        Even so, Belovèd, I at last record,<br>
        Here ends my strife. If thou invite me forth,<br>
        I rise above abasement at the word.<br>
        Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth.
      </p>

      <h2>XVII</h2>

      <p>
        MY poet, thou canst touch on all the notes<br>
        God set between His After and Before,<br>
        And strike up and strike off the general roar<br>
        Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats<br>
        In a serene air purely. Antidotes<br>
        Of medicated music, answering for<br>
        Mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour<br>
        From thence into their ears. God’s will devotes<br>
        Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.<br>
        How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?<br>
        A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine<br>
        Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?<br>
        A shade, in which to sing—of palm or pine?<br>
        A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose.
      </p>

      <h2>XVIII</h2>

      <p>
        I NEVER gave a lock of hair away<br>
        To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,<br>
        Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,<br>
        I ring out to the full brown length and say<br>
        “Take it.” My day of youth went yesterday:<br>
        My hair no longer bounds to my foot’s glee,<br>
        Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,<br>
        As girls do, any more; it only may<br>
        Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,<br>
        Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside<br>
        Through sorrow’s trick. I thought the funeral-shears<br>
        Would take this first, but love is justified,—<br>
        Take it thou, finding pure, from all those years,<br>
        The kiss my mother left here when she died.
      </p>

      <h2>XIX</h2>

      <p>
        THE SOUL’S Rialto hath its merchandise;<br>
        I barter curl for curl upon that mart,<br>
        And from my poet’s forehead to my heart<br>
        Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—<br>
        As purply black, as erst to Pindar’s eyes<br>
        The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart<br>
        The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart,<br>
        The bay-crown’s shade, Belovèd, I surmise,<br>
        Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!<br>
        Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,<br>
        I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,<br>
        And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;<br>
        Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack<br>
        No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
      </p>

      <h2>XX</h2>

      <p>
        BELOVÈD, my Belovèd, when I think<br>
        That thou wast in the world a year ago,<br>
        What time I sat alone here in the snow<br>
        And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink<br>
        No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,<br>
        Went counting all my chains as if that so<br>
        They never could fall off at any blow<br>
        Struck by thy possible hand,—why, thus I drink<br>
        Of life’s great cup of wonder! Wonderful,<br>
        Never to feel thee thrill the day or night<br>
        With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull<br>
        Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white<br>
        Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull,<br>
        Who cannot guess God’s presence out of sight.
      </p>

      <h2>XXI</h2>

      <p>
        SAY over again, and yet once over again,<br>
        That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated<br>
        Should seem “a cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat it,<br>
        Remember, never to the hill or plain,<br>
        Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain<br>
        Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.<br>
        Belovèd, I, amid the darkness greeted<br>
        By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt’s pain<br>
        Cry, “Speak once more—thou lovest!” Who can fear<br>
        Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,<br>
        Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?<br>
        Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll<br>
        The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,<br>
        To love me also in silence with thy soul.
      </p>

      <h2>XXII</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN our two souls stand up erect and strong,<br>
        Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,<br>
        Until the lengthening wings break into fire<br>
        At either curvèd point,—what bitter wrong<br>
        Can the earth do to us, that we should not long<br>
        Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,<br>
        The angels would press on us and aspire<br>
        To drop some golden orb of perfect song<br>
        Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay<br>
        Rather on earth, Belovèd,—where the unfit<br>
        Contrarious moods of men recoil away<br>
        And isolate pure spirits, and permit<br>
        A place to stand and love in for a day,<br>
        With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
      </p>

      <h2>XXIII</h2>

      <p>
        IS it indeed so? If I lay here dead,<br>
        Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?<br>
        And would the sun for thee more coldly shine<br>
        Because of grave-damps falling round my head?<br>
        I marvelled, my Belovèd, when I read<br>
        Thy thought so in the letter. I am thine—<br>
        But … so much to thee? Can I pour thy wine<br>
        While my hands tremble? Then my soul, instead<br>
        Of dreams of death, resumes life’s lower range.<br>
        Then, love me, Love! look on me—breathe on me!<br>
        As brighter ladies do not count it strange,<br>
        For love, to give up acres and degree,<br>
        I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange<br>
        My near sweet view of Heaven, for earth with thee!
      </p>

      <h2>XXIV</h2>

      <p>
        LET the world’s sharpness, like a clasping knife,<br>
        Shut in upon itself and do no harm<br>
        In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,<br>
        And let us hear no sound of human strife<br>
        After the click of the shutting. Life to life—<br>
        I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,<br>
        And feel as safe as guarded by a charm<br>
        Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife<br>
        Are weak to injure. Very whitely still<br>
        The lilies of our lives may reassure<br>
        Their blossoms from their roots, accessible<br>
        Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer,<br>
        Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.

      <p>
        God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.
