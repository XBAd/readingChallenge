      <h2>I</h2>

      <p>
        [1] THE MASTER said: “In learning and straightway practising is there not pleasure also? When friends gather round from afar do we not rejoice? Whom lack of fame cannot vex is not he a gentleman?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [2] Yu-tzu said: “A dutiful son and brother is seldom fond of thwarting those over him: a man unwilling to thwart those over him is never given to crime. A gentleman nurses the roots: when the root has taken, the truth will grow; and what are the roots of love, but the duty of son and of brother?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [3] The Master said: “Honeyed words and flattering looks seldom speak of love.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [4] Tseng-tzu said: “Thrice daily I ask myself: ‘Have I been unfaithful in dealing for others? Have I been untrue to friends? Do I practise what I preach?’”
      </p>

      <p>
        [5] The Master said: “To guide a land of a thousand chariots, honour business, be true and sparing, love the people, and time thy claims upon them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [6] The Master said: “The young should be dutiful at home, modest abroad, heedful and true, full of goodwill for the many, close friends with love; and should they have strength to spare, let them spend it upon the arts.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [7] Tzu-hsia said: “If a man honour worth and forsake lust, serve father and mother with all his strength, be ready to give his life for the king, and keep faith with his friends; though men may call him rude, I call him learned.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [8] The Master said: “Of a gentleman who is frivolous none stand in awe, nor can his learning be sound. Make faithfulness and truth thy masters: have no friends unlike thyself: be not ashamed to mend thy faults.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [9] Tseng-tzu said: “Respect death and recall forefathers, the good in men will again grow sturdy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [10] Tzu-ch´in said to Tzu-kung: “The Master, on coming to a country, learns all about the government: does he ask, or is it told him?” <br>
        Tzu-kung said: “The Master learns it by his warmth and honesty, by politeness, modesty, and yielding. The way that the Master asks is unlike other men’s asking.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [11] The Master said: “As long as his father lives a son should study his wishes; after he is dead, he should study his life. If for three years he do not forsake his father’s ways, he may be called dutiful.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [12] Yu-tzu said: “In daily courtesy ease is of price. This was the beauty of the old kings’ ways; this they followed in small and great. But knowing this, it is not right to give way to ease, unchecked by courtesy. This also is wrong.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [13] Yu-tzu said: “If promises hug the right, word can be kept: if attentions are bounded by courtesy, shame will be banished: heroes may be worshipped, if we choose them aright.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [14] The Master said: “A gentleman who is not a greedy eater, nor a lover of ease at home, who is earnest in deed and careful of speech, who seeks the righteous and profits by them, may be called fond of learning.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [15] Tzu-kung said: “Poor, but no flatterer; rich, but not proud. How were that?” <br>
        “Good,” said the Master; “but better still were poor, yet merry; rich, yet courteous.” <br>
        Tzu-kung said: “Where the poem says: <br>

        <blockquote>
          ‘If ye cut, if ye file, <br>
          If ye polish and grind’;
        </blockquote>

        is that what is meant?” <br>
        The Master said: “Now I can talk of poetry to thee, Tz´u. Given a clue, thou canst find the way.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [16] The Master said: “Not to be known should not grieve you: grieve that ye know not men.”
      </p>

      <h2>II</h2>

      <p>
        [1] THE MASTER said: “In governing, cleave to good; as the north star holds his place, and the multitude of stars revolve upon him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [2] The Master said: “To sum up the three hundred songs in a word, they are free from evil thought.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [3] The Master said: “Guide the people by law, subdue them by punishment; they may shun crime, but will be void of shame. Guide them by example, subdue them by courtesy; they will learn shame, and come to be good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [4] The Master said: “At fifteen, I was bent on study; at thirty, I could stand; at forty, doubts ceased; at fifty, I understood the laws of Heaven; at sixty, my ears obeyed me; at seventy, I could do as my heart lusted, and never swerve from right.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [5] Meng Yi asked the duty of a son. <br>
        The Master said: “Obedience.” <br>
        As Fan Ch´ih was driving him, the Master said: “Meng-sun asked me the duty of a son; I answered ‘Obedience.’” <br>
        “What did ye mean?” said Fan Ch´ih. <br>
        “To serve our parents with courtesy whilst they live,” said the Master; “to bury them with all courtesy when they die; and to worship them with all courtesy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [6] Meng Wu asked the duty of a son. <br>
        The Master said: “What weighs on your father and mother is concern for your health.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [7] Tzu-yu asked the duty of a son. <br>
        The Master said: “To-day a man is called dutiful if he keep his father and mother. But we keep both our dogs and horses, and unless we honour parents, is it not all one?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [8] Tzu-hsia asked the duty of a son. <br>
        The Master said: “Our manner is the hard part. For the young to be a stay in toil, and leave the wine and cakes to their elders, is this to fulfil their duty?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [9] The Master said: “If I talk all day to Hui, like a dullard, he never stops me. But when he is gone, if I pry into his life, I find he can do what I say. No, Hui is no dullard.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [10] The Master said: “Look at a man’s acts; watch his motives; find out what pleases him: can the man evade you? Can the man evade you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [11] The Master said: “Who keeps the old akindle and adds new knowledge is fitted to be a teacher.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [12] The Master said: “A gentleman is not a vessel.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [13] Tzu-kung asked, What is a gentleman? <br>
        The Master said: “He puts words into deed first, and sorts what he says to the deed.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [14] The Master said: “A gentleman is broad and fair: the vulgar are biassed and petty.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [15] The Master said: “Study without thought is vain: thought without study is dangerous.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [16] The Master said: “Work on strange doctrines does harm.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [17] The Master said: “Yu, shall I teach thee what is understanding? To know what we know, and know what we do not know, that is understanding.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [18] Tzu-chang studied with an eye to pay. <br>
        The Master said: “Listen much, keep silent when in doubt, and always take heed of the tongue; thou wilt make few mistakes. See much, beware of pitfalls, and always give heed to thy walk; thou wilt have little to rue. If thy words are seldom wrong, thy deeds leave little to rue, pay will follow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [19] Duke Ai asked: “What should be done to make the people loyal?” <br>
        Confucius answered: “Exalt the straight, set aside the crooked, the people will be loyal. Exalt the crooked, set aside the straight, the people will be disloyal.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [20] Chi K´ang asked how to make the people lowly, faithful, and willing. <br>
        The Master said: “Behave with dignity, they will be lowly: be pious and merciful, they will be faithful: exalt the good, teach the unskilful, they will grow willing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [21] One said to Confucius: “Why are ye not in power, Sir?” <br>
        The Master answered: “What does the book say of a good son? ‘An always dutiful son, who is a friend to his brothers, showeth the way to rule.’ This also is to rule. What need to be in power?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [22] The Master said: “Without truth I know not how man can live. A cart without a crosspole, a carriage without harness, how could they be moved?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [23] Tzu-chang asked whether we can know what is to be ten generations hence. <br>
        The Master said: “The Yin inherited the manners of the Hsia; the harm and the good that they wrought them is known. The Chou inherited the manners of the Yin; the harm and the good that they wrought them is known. And we may know what is to be, even an hundred generations hence, when others follow Chou.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [24] The Master said: “To worship the ghosts of strangers is fawning. To see the right and not do it is want of courage.”
      </p>

      <h2>III</h2>

      <p>
        [1] OF the Chi having eight rows of dancers in his hall, Confucius said: “If this is to be borne, what is not to be borne?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [2] At the end of worship, the Three Clans made use of the Yung hymn. <br>
        The Master said:

        <blockquote>
          “‘The dukes and princes assist, <br>
          Solemn is the Son of Heaven;’ <br>
          what sense has this in the hall of the Three Clans?”
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        [3]
          The Master said: “A man without love, what is courtesy to him? A man without love, what is music to him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [4]
          Lin Fang asked, What is the life of ceremony? <br>
          The Master said: “A great question! At hightides, waste is worse than thrift: at burials, grief outweighs nicety.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [5]
          The Master said: “The wild tribes have kings; whilst the realm of Hsia is without!”
      </p>

      <p>
        [6]
          The Chi worshipped on Mount T´ai. <br>
          The Master said to Jan Yu: “Canst thou not stop this?” <br>
          He answered: “I cannot.” <br>
          “Alas!” said the Master; “dost thou set Mount T´ai below Lin Fang?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [7]
          The Master said: “A gentleman has no rivalries-except perhaps in archery; and then, as bowing he joins the winners, or steps down to see the loser drink, throughout the struggle he is still the gentleman.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [8]
          Tzu-hsia asked: “What is the meaning of:

          <blockquote>
            ‘Her cunning smiles, <br>
            Her dimples light, <br>
            Her lovely eyes, <br>
            So clear and bright, <br>
            The ground, not yet <br>
            With colours dight’?”
          </blockquote>

          The Master said: “Colouring follows groundwork.” <br>
          “Then does courtesy follow after?” said Tzu-hsia. <br>
          “Shang,” said the Master, “thou hast hit my meaning! Now I can talk of poetry to thee.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [9]
          The Master said: “I can speak of the manners of Hsia; but for Chi witnesses fail. I can speak of the manners of Yin; but for Sung witnesses fail. This is due to their dearth of books and great men. Were there enough of these, they would witness for me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [10]
          The Master said: “After the drink offering at the Great Sacrifice, I have no wish to see more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [11]
          One asked about the words of the Great Sacrifice.
      </p>

      <p>
        [12]
          The Master said: “I do not understand them. Could one understand them, he would overlook the world as I this”—and he pointed to his palm.
      </p>

      <p>
        [13]
          Worship as though those ye worship stood before you; worship the spirits, as though they stood before you. <br>
          The Master said: “If I take no part in the sacrifice, it is none to me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [14]
          Wang-sun Chia said: “What is the meaning of ‘it is better to court the Kitchen God than the God of the Home’?” <br>
          “Not at all,” said the Master. “A sin against Heaven is past praying for.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [15]
          The Master said: “Two lines of kings have passed beneath the ken of Chou. How rich in art is Chou! It is Chou I follow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [16]
          On entering the Great Temple, the Master asked how each thing was done. <br>
          One said: “Who says that the man of Tsou’s son has a knowledge of ceremony? On entering the Great Temple, he asked how each thing was done!” <br>
          On hearing this, the Master said: “Such is the ceremony.
      </p>

      <p>
        [17]
          The Master said: “To pierce through the target does not score in archery; because men differ in strength. This was the old rule.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [18]
          Tzu-kung wished to do away with the sheep offering at the new moon. The Master said: “Thou lovest the sheep, Tz´u: I love the rite.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [19]
          The Master said: “Treat the king with all courtesy, men call it fawning.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [20]
          Duke Ting asked how a king should behave to his ministers; how ministers should serve their king? <br>
          Confucius answered: “A king should behave with courtesy to his ministers; ministers should serve their king faithfully.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [21]
          The Master said: “The poem ‘The Osprey’ is glad, but not wanton; it is sad, but not morbid.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [22]
          Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the shrines of the guardian spirits. Tsai Wo answered: “The Hsia Emperors grew firs round them; the men of Yin grew cypress; the men of Chou grew chestnut, meaning ‘jest not over holy matters.’” <br>
          On hearing this, the Master said: “I do not speak of what is ended, chide what is settled, or find fault with what is past.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [23]
          The Master said: “How shallow was Kuan Chung!” <br>
          “But,” said one, “was not Kuan Chung thrifty?” <br>
          “Kuan owned San Kuei, and in his household none doubled offices,” said the Master; “was that thrift?” <br>
          “At least Kuan Chung was versed in courtesy.” <br>
          The Master said: “Kings screen their gates with trees; Kuan, too, had trees to screen his gate. When two kings make merry together, they have a stand for the turned-down cups; Kuan had a turned-down cup-stand too! If Kuan were versed in courtesy, who is not versed in courtesy?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [24]
          The Master said to the chief musician of Lu: “How to play music may be known. At first each part in unison; then, a swell of harmony, each part distinct, rolling on to the finish.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [25]
          The warden of Yi asked to see Confucius, saying: “No gentleman has ever come here, whom I have failed to see.” <br>
          The followers presented him. <br>
          On leaving he said: “My lads, why lament your fall? The world has long been astray. Heaven will make of the Master a warning bell.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [26]
          The Master said: “All beautiful and noble is the music of Shao! The music of Wu is as beautiful, but less noble.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [27]
          The Master said: “Rank without bounty; ritual without reverence; mourning without grief, why should I cast them a glance?”
      </p>

      <h2>IV</h2>

      <p>
        [1]
          THE MASTER said: “Love makes a spot beautiful: who chooses not to dwell in love, has he got wisdom?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [2]
          The Master said: “Loveless men cannot bear need long, they cannot bear fortune long. Loving hearts find peace in love; clever heads find profit in it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [3]
          The Master said: “Love can alone love others, or hate others.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [4]
          The Master said: “A heart set on love will do no wrong.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [5]
          The Master said: “Wealth and honours are what men desire; but abide not in them by help of wrong. Lowliness and want are hated of men; but forsake them not by help of wrong. <br>
          “Shorn of love, is a gentleman worthy the name? Not for one moment may a gentleman sin against love; not in flurry and haste, nor yet in utter overthrow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [6]
          The Master said: “A friend to love, a foe to evil, I have yet to meet. A friend to love will set nothing higher. In love’s service, a foe to evil will let no evil touch him. Were a man to give himself to love, but for one day, I have seen no one whose strength would fail him. Such men there may be, but I have not seen one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [7]
          The Master said: “A man and his faults are of a piece. By watching his faults we learn whether love be his.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [8]
          The Master said: “To learn the truth at daybreak and die at eve were enough.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [9]
          The Master said: “A scholar in search of truth who is ashamed of poor clothes and poor food it is idle talking to.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [10]
          The Master said: “A gentleman has no likes and no dislikes below heaven. He follows right.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [11]
          The Master said: “Gentlemen cherish worth; the vulgar cherish dirt. Gentlemen trust in justice; the vulgar trust in favour.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [12]
          The Master said: “The chase of gain is rich in hate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [13]
          The Master said: “What is it to sway a kingdom by courteous yielding? Who cannot by courteous yielding sway a kingdom, what can he know of courtesy?”
      </p>

      <p>
        [14]
          The Master said: “Be not concerned at want of place; be concerned that thou stand thyself. Sorrow not at being unknown, but seek to be worthy of note.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [15]
          The Master said: “One thread, Shen, runs through all my teaching.” <br>
          “Yes,” said Tseng-tzu. <br>
          After the Master had left, the disciples asked what was meant. <br>
          Tseng-tzu said: “The Master’s teaching all hangs on faithfulness and fellow-feeling.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [16]
          The Master said: “A gentleman considers what is right; the vulgar consider what will pay.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [17]
          The Master said: “At sight of worth, think to grow like it. When evil meets thee, search thine own heart.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [18]
          The Master said: “A father or mother may be gently chidden. If they will not bend, be the more lowly, but persevere; nor murmur if trouble follow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [19]
          The Master said: “Whilst thy father and mother live, do not wander afar. If thou must travel, hold a set course.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [20]
          The Master said: “If for three years a son do not forsake his father’s ways, he may be called dutiful.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [21]
          The Master said: “A father’s and a mother’s age must be borne in mind; with joy on the one hand, fear on the other.”
      </p>

      <p>
        [22]
