      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        That I my anxious zeal may prove, <br>
        Your pangs to sooth and aid your love,<br>
        A single moment will we not delay,<br>
        Will lead you to her room this very day.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        And shall I see her?—Have her?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        No!
      She to a neighbour’s house will go;<br>
      But in her atmosphere alone,<br>
      The tedious hours meanwhile you may employ,<br>
      In blissful dreams of future joy.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Can we go now?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis yet too soon.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Some present for my love procure!  (Exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Presents so soon! ’tis well! success is sure!<br>
        Full many a goodly place I know,<br>
        And treasures buried long ago;<br>
        I must a bit o’erlook them now.  (Exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>EVENING. A SMALL AND NEAT ROOM</h3>

      <h3>MARGARET (braiding and binding up her hair)</h3>

      <p>
        I would give something now to know,<br>
        Who yonder gentleman could be!<br>
        He had a gallant air, I trow,<br>
        And doubtless was of high degree:<br>
        That written on his brow was seen—<br>
        Nor else would he so bold have been.  (Exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Come in! tread softly! be discreet!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST  (after a pause)</h3>

      <p>
        Begone and leave me, I entreat!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES  (looking round)</h3>

      <p>
        Not every maiden is so neat  (Exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST  (gazing round)</h3>

      <p>
        Welcome sweet twilight, calm and blest,<br>
        That in this hallow’d precinct reigns!<br>
        Fond yearning love, inspire my breast,<br>
        Feeding on hope’s sweet dew thy blissful pains!<br>
        What stillness here environs me!<br>
        Content and order brood around.<br>
        What fulness in this poverty!<br>
        In this small cell what bliss profound!  (He throws himself on the leather arm-chair beside the bed)<br>
        Receive me thou, who hast in thine embrace,<br>
        Welcom’d in joy and grief the ages flown!<br>
        How oft the children of a by-gone race<br>
        Have cluster’d round this patriarchal throne!<br>
        Haply she, also, whom I hold so dear,<br>
        For Christmas gift, with grateful joy possess’d,<br>
        Hath with the full round cheek of childhood, here,<br>
        Her grandsire’s wither’d hand devoutly press’d.<br>
        Maiden! I feel thy spirit haunt the place,<br>
        Breathing of order and abounding grace.<br>
        As with a mother’s voice it prompteth thee,<br>
        The pure white cover o’er the board to spread,<br>
        To strew the crisping sand beneath thy tread.<br>
        Dear hand! so godlike in its ministry!<br>
        The hut becomes a paradise through thee!<br>
        And here—  (He raises the bed-curtain.)<br>
        How thrills my pulse with strange delight!<br>
        Here could I linger hours untold;<br>
        Thou, Nature, didst in vision bright,<br>
        The embryo angel here unfold.<br>
        Here lay the child, her bosom warm<br>
        With life; while steeped in slumber’s dew,<br>
        To perfect grace, her godlike form,<br>
        With pure and hallow’d weavings grew!
      </p>

      <p>
        And thou! ah here what seekest thou?<br>
        How quails mine inmost being now!<br>
        What wouldst thou here? what makes thy heart so sore?<br>
        Unhappy Faust! I know thee now no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do I a magic atmosphere inhale?<br>
        Erewhile, my passion would not brook delay!<br>
        Now in a pure love-dream I melt away.<br>
        Are we the sport of every passing gale?
      </p>

      <p>
        Should she return and enter now,<br>
        How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame!<br>
        Proud vaunter—thou wouldst hide thy brow,—<br>
        And at her feet sink down with shame.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Quick! quick! below I see her there.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Away! I will return no more!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Here is a casket, with a store<br>
        Of jewels, which I got elsewhere<br>
        Just lay it in the press; make haste!<br>
        I swear to you, ’twill turn her brain;<br>
        Therein some trifles I have placed,<br>
        Wherewith another to obtain.<br>
        But child is child, and play is play.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        I know not—shall I?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Do you ask?<br>
      Perchance you would retain the treasure?<br>
      If such your wish, why then, I say,<br>
      Henceforth absolve me from my task,<br>
      Nor longer waste your hours of leisure.<br>
      I trust you’re not by avarice led!<br>
      I rub my hands, I scratch my head,—  (He places the casket in the press and closes the lock.)<br>
      Now quick! Away!<br>
      That soon the sweet young creature may<br>
      The wish and purpose of your heart obey;<br>
      Yet stand you there<br>
      As would you to the lecture-room repair,<br>
      As if before you stood,<br>
      Arrayed in flesh and blood,<br>
      Physics and metaphysics weird and grey!—<br>
      Away!  (Exeunt.)
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET  (with a lamp)</h3>

      <p>
        Here ’tis so close, so sultry now,  (She opens the window.)<br>
      Yet out of doors ’tis not so warm.<br>
      I feel so strange, I know not how—<br>
      I wish my mother would come home.<br>
      Through me there runs a shuddering—<br>
      I’m but a foolish timid thing!  (While undressing herself she begins to sing.)<br>
      There was a king in Thule,<br>
      True even to the grave;<br>
      To whom his dying mistress<br>
      A golden beaker gave.
      </p>

      <p>
        At every feast he drained it,<br>
        Naught was to him so dear,<br>
        And often as he drained it,<br>
        Gush’d from his eyes the tear.
      </p>

      <p>
        When death came, unrepining<br>
        His cities o’er he told;<br>
        All to his heir resigning,<br>
        Except his cup of gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        With many a knightly vassal<br>
        At a royal feast sat he,<br>
        In yon proud hall ancestral,<br>
        In his castle o’er the sea.
      </p>

      <p>
        Up stood the jovial monarch,<br>
        And quaff’d his last life’s glow,<br>
        Then hurled the hallow’d goblet<br>
        Into the flood below.
      </p>

      <p>
        He saw it splashing, drinking,<br>
        And plunging in the sea;<br>
        His eyes meanwhile were sinking,<br>
        And never again drank he.  (She opens the press to put away her clothes, and perceives the casket.)<br>
      How comes this lovely casket here? The press<br>
      I locked, of that I’m confident.<br>
      ’Tis very wonderful! What’s in it I can’t guess;<br>
      Perhaps ’twas brought by some one in distress,<br>
      And left in pledge for loan my mother lent.<br>
      Here by a ribbon hangs a little key!<br>
      I have a mind to open it and see!<br>
      Heavens! only look! what have we here!<br>
      In all my days ne’er saw I such a sight!<br>
      Jewels! which any noble dame might wear,<br>
      For some high pageant richly dight!<br>
      This chain—how would it look on me!<br>
      These splendid gems, whose may they be?  (She puts them on and steps before the glass.)<br>
      Were but the ear-rings only mine!<br>
      Thus one has quite another air.<br>
      What boots it to be young and fair?<br>
      It doubtless may be very fine;<br>
      But then, alas, none cares for you,<br>
      And praise sounds half like pity too.<br>
      Gold all doth lure,<br>
      Gold doth secure<br>
      All things. Alas, we poor!
      </p>

      <h3>PROMENADE</h3>
      <em>FAUST walking thoughtfully up and down. To him MEPHISTOPHELES</em>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        By all rejected love! By hellish fire I curse,<br>
        Would I knew aught to make my imprecation worse!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        What aileth thee? what chafes thee now so sore?<br>
        A face like that I never saw before!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        I’d yield me to the devil instantly,<br>
        Did it not happen that myself am he!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        There must be some disorder in thy wit!<br>
        To rave thus like a madman, is it fit?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Think! only think! The gems for Gretchen brought,<br>
        Them hath a priest now made his own!—<br>
        A glimpse of them the mother caught,<br>
        And ’gan with secret fear to groan.<br>
        The woman’s scent is keen enough;<br>
        Doth ever in the prayer-book snuff;<br>
        Smells every article to ascertain<br>
        Whether the thing is holy or profane,<br>
        And scented in the jewels rare,<br>
        That there was not much blessing there.<br>
        “My child,” she cries, “ill-gotten good<br>
        Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood;<br>
        With them we’ll deck our Lady’s shrine,<br>
        She’ll cheer our souls with bread divine!”<br>
        At this poor Gretchen ’gan to pout;<br>
        ’Tis a gift-horse, at least, she thought,<br>
        And sure, he godless cannot be,<br>
        Who brought them here so cleverly.<br>
        Straight for a priest the mother sent,<br>
        Who, when he understood the jest,<br>
        With what he saw was well content.<br>
        “This shows a pious mind!” Quoth he:<br>
        “Self-conquest is true victory.<br>
        The Church hath a good stomach, she, with zest,<br>
        Whole countries hath swallow’d down,<br>
        And never yet a surfeit known.<br>
        The Church alone, be it confessed,<br>
        Daughters, can ill-got wealth digest.”
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        It is a general custom, too.<br>
        Practised alike by king and jew.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        With that, clasp, chain, and ring, he swept<br>
        As they were mushrooms; and the casket,<br>
        Without one word of thanks, he kept,<br>
        As if of nuts it were a basket.<br>
        Promised reward in heaven, then forth he hied—<br>
        And greatly they were edified.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        And Gretchen!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        In unquiet mood<br>
      Knows neither what she would or should;<br>
      The trinkets night and day thinks o’er,<br>
      On him who brought them, dwells still more.
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        The darling’s sorrow grieves me, bring<br>
        Another set without delay!<br>
        The first, methinks, was no great thing.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        All’s to my gentleman child’s play!
      </p>

      <h3>FAUST</h3>

      <p>
        Plan all things to achieve my end!<br>
        Engage the attention of her friend!<br>
        No milk-and-water devil be,<br>
        And bring fresh jewels instantly!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Ay, sir! Most gladly I’ll obey. (FAUST exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Your doting love-sick fool, with ease,<br>
        Merely his lady-love to please,<br>
        Sun, moon, and stars in sport would puff away.  (Exit.)
      </p>

      <h3>THE NEIGHBOUR’S HOUSE</h3>
      <h3>MARTHA  (alone)</h3>

      <p>
        God pardon my dear husband, he<br>
        Doth not in truth act well by me!<br>
        Forth in the world abroad to roam,<br>
        And leave me on the straw at home.<br>
        And yet his will I ne’er did thwart,<br>
        God knows, I lov’d him from my heart.  (She weeps.)<br>
        Perchance he’s dead!—oh wretched state!—<br>
        Had I but a certificate!  (MARGARET comes)
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Dame Martha!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Gretchen?
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Only think!<br>
      My knees beneath me well-nigh sink!<br>
      Within my press I’ve found to-day,<br>
      Another case, of ebony.<br>
      And things—magnificent they are,<br>
      More costly than the first, by far.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        You must not name it to your mother!<br>
        It would to shrift, just like the other.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Nay look at them! now only see!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (dresses her up)</h3>

      <p>
        Thou happy creature!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Woe is me!<br>
      Them in the street I cannot wear,<br>
      Or in the church, or any where.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Come often over here to me,<br>
        The gems put on quite privately;<br>
        And then before the mirror walk an hour or so,<br>
        Thus we shall have our pleasure too.<br>
        Then suitable occasions we must seize,<br>
        As at a feast, to show them by degrees:<br>
        A chain at first, pearl ear-drops then,—your mother<br>
        Won’t see them, or we’ll coin some tale or other.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        But, who, I wonder, could the caskets bring?<br>
        I fear there’s something wrong about the thing!  (A knock.)<br>
        Good heavens! can that my mother be?
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (peering through the blind)</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis a strange gentleman, I see.<br>
        Come in!  (MEPHISTOPHELES enters)
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        I’ve ventur’d to intrude to-day.<br>
      Ladies, excuse the liberty, I pray.  (He steps back respectfully before MARGARET.)<br>
      After dame Martha Schwerdtlein I inquire!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis I. Pray what have you to say to me?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES  (aside to her)</h3>

      <p>
        I know you now,—and therefore will retire;<br>
        At present you’ve distinguished company.<br>
        Pardon the freedom, Madam, with your leave,<br>
        I will make free to call again at eve.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (aloud)</h3>

      <p>
        Why, child, of all strange notions, he<br>
        For some grand lady taketh thee!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        I am, in truth, of humble blood—<br>
        The gentleman is far too good—<br>
        Nor gems nor trinkets are my own.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Oh ’tis not the mere ornaments alone;<br>
        Her glance and mien far more betray.<br>
        Rejoiced I am that I may stay.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Your business, Sir? I long to know—
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Would I could happier tidings show!<br>
        I trust mine errand you’ll not let me rue;<br>
        Your husband’s dead, and greeteth you.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Is dead? True heart! Oh misery!<br>
        My husband dead! Oh, I shall die!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Alas! good Martha! don’t despair!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Now listen to the sad affair!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        I for this cause should fear to love.<br>
        The loss my certain death would prove.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Joy still must sorrow, sorrow joy attend.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Proceed, and tell the story of his end!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        At Padua, in St. Anthony’s,<br>
        In holy ground his body lies;<br>
        Quiet and cool his place of rest,<br>
        With pious ceremonials blest.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        And had you naught besides to bring?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Oh yes! one grave and solemn prayer;<br>
        Let them for him three hundred masses sing!<br>
        But in my pockets, I have nothing there.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        No trinket! no love-token did he send!<br>
        What every journeyman safe in his pouch will hoard<br>
        There for remembrance fondly stored,<br>
        And rather hungers, rather begs than spend!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Madam, in truth, it grieves me sore,<br>
        But he his gold not lavishly hath spent.<br>
        His failings too he deeply did repent,<br>
        Ay! and his evil plight bewail’d still more.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Alas! That men should thus be doomed to woe!<br>
        I for his soul will many a requiem pray.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        A husband you deserve this very day;<br>
        A child so worthy to be loved.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Ah no,<br>
      That time hath not yet come for me.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        If not a spouse, a gallant let it be.<br>
        Among heaven’s choicest gifts, I place,<br>
        So sweet a darling to embrace.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Our land doth no such usage know.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Usage or not, it happens so.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Go on, I pray!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        I stood by his bedside.<br>
      Something less foul it was than dung;<br>
      ’Twas straw half rotten; yet, he as a Christian died.<br>
      And sorely hath remorse his conscience wrung.<br>
      “Wretch that I was,” quoth he, with parting breath,<br>
      “So to forsake my business and my wife!<br>
      Ah! the remembrance is my death,<br>
      Could I but have her pardon in this life!”—
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA  (weeping)</h3>

      <p>
        Dear soul! I’ve long forgiven him, indeed!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        “Though she, God knows, was more to blame than I.”
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        He lied! What, on the brink of death to lie!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        If I am skill’d the countenance to read,<br>
        He doubtless fabled as he parted hence.—<br>
        “No time had I to gape, or take my ease,” he said,<br>
        “First to get children, and then get them bread;<br>
        And bread, too, in the very widest sense;<br>
        Nor could I eat in peace even my proper share.”
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        What, all my truth, my love forgotten quite?<br>
        My weary drudgery by day and night!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Not so! He thought of you with tender care.<br>
        Quoth he: “Heaven knows how fervently I prayed,<br>
        For wife and children when from Malta bound;—<br>
        The prayer hath heaven with favour crowned;<br>
        We took a Turkish vessel which conveyed<br>
        Rich store of treasure for the Sultan’s court;<br>
        It’s own reward our gallant action brought;<br>
        The captur’d prize was shared among the crew<br>
        And of the treasure I received my due.”
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        How? Where? The treasure hath he buried, pray?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Where the four winds have blown it, who can say?<br>
        In Naples as he stroll’d, a stranger there,—<br>
        A comely maid took pity on my friend;<br>
        And gave such tokens of her love and care,<br>
        That he retained them to his blessed end.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Scoundrel! to rob his children of their bread!<br>
        And all this misery, this bitter need,<br>
        Could not his course of recklessness impede!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Well, he hath paid the forfeit, and is dead.<br>
        Now were I in your place, my counsel hear;<br>
        My weeds I’d wear for one chaste year,<br>
        And for another lover meanwhile would look out.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        Alas, I might search far and near,<br>
        Not quickly should I find another like my first!<br>
        There could not be a fonder fool than mine,<br>
        Only he loved too well abroad to roam;<br>
        Loved foreign women too, and foreign wine,<br>
        And loved besides the dice accurs’d.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        All had gone swimmingly, no doubt,<br>
        Had he but given you at home,<br>
        On his side, just as wide a range.<br>
        Upon such terms, to you I swear,<br>
        Myself with you would gladly rings exchange!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        The gentleman is surely pleas’d to jest!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES (aside)</h3>

      <p>
        Now to be off in time, were best!<br>
        She’d make the very devil marry her.  (To MARGARET.)<br>
        How fares it with your heart?
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        How mean you, Sir?
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES  (aside)</h3>

      <p>
        The sweet young innocent!  (aloud)<br>
                        Ladies, farewell!
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        Farewell!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        But ere you leave us, quickly tell!<br>
      I from a witness fain had heard,<br>
      Where, how, and when my husband died and was interr’d.<br>
      To forms I’ve always been attached indeed,<br>
      His death I fain would in the journals read.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Ay, madam, what two witnesses declare<br>
        Is held as valid everywhere;<br>
        A gallant friend I have, not far from here,<br>
        Who will for you before the judge appear.<br>
        I’ll bring him straight.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        I pray you do!
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        And this young lady, we shall find her too?<br>
        A noble youth, far travelled, he<br>
        Shows to the sex all courtesy.
      </p>

      <h3>MARGARET</h3>

      <p>
        I in his presence needs must blush for shame.
      </p>

      <h3>MEPHISTOPHELES</h3>

      <p>
        Not in the presence of a crowned king!
      </p>

      <h3>MARTHA</h3>

      <p>
        The garden, then, behind my house, we’ll name,<br>
        There we’ll await you both this evening.
