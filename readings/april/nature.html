      <h2>The Daffodils</h2>

      <p>
        I WANDER’D lonely as a cloud <br>
        That floats on high o’er vales and hills,<br>
        When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
        A host of golden daffodils,<br>
        Beside the lake, beneath the trees<br>
        Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
        And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
        They stretch’d in never-ending line<br>
        Along the margin of a bay:<br>
        Ten thousand saw I at a glance<br>
        Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The waves beside them danced, but they<br>
        Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:—<br>
        A Poet could not but be gay<br>
        In such a jocund company!<br>
        I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
        What wealth the show to me had brought;
      </p>

      <p>
        For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
        In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
        They flash upon that inward eye<br>
        Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
        And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
        And dances with the daffodils.
      </p>

      <h2>To the Daisy</h2>

      <p>
        WITH little here to do or see<br>
        Of things that in the great world be,<br>
        Sweet Daisy! oft I talk to thee<br>
              For thou art worthy,<br>
        Thou unassuming commonplace<br>
        Of Nature, with that homely face,<br>
        And yet with something of a grace<br>
              Which love makes for thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        Oft on the dappled turf at ease<br>
        I sit and play with similes,<br>
        Loose types of things through all degrees,<br>
              Thoughts of thy raising;<br>
        And many a fond and idle name<br>
        I give to thee, for praise or blame<br>
        As is the humour of the game,<br>
              While I am gazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        A nun demure, of lowly port;<br>
        Or sprightly maiden, of Love’s court,<br>
        In thy simplicity the sport<br>
              Of all temptations;<br>
        A queen in crown of rubies drest;<br>
        A starveling in a scanty vest;<br>
        Are all, as seems to suit thee best,<br>
              Thy appellations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A little Cyclops, with one eye<br>
        Staring to threaten and defy,<br>
        That thought comes next—and instantly<br>
              The freak is over,<br>
        The shape will vanish, and behold!<br>
        A silver shield with boss of gold<br>
        That spreads itself, some fairy bold<br>
              In fight to cover.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see thee glittering from afar—<br>
        And then thou art a pretty star,<br>
        Not quite so fair as many are<br>
              In heaven above thee!<br>
        Yet like a star, with glittering crest,<br>
        Self-poised in air thou seem’st to rest;—<br>
        May peace come never to his nest<br>
              Who shall reprove thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        Sweet Flower! for by that name at last<br>
        When all my reveries are past,<br>
        I call thee, and to that cleave fast,<br>
              Sweet silent Creature!<br>
        That breath’st with me in sun and air,<br>
        Do thou, as thou art wont, repair<br>
        My heart with gladness, and a share<br>
              Of thy meek nature!
      </p>

      <h2>To the Cuckoo</h2>

      <p>
        O BLITHE new-comer! I have heard,<br>
        I hear thee and rejoice:<br>
        O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird,<br>
        Or but a wandering Voice?
      </p>

      <p>
        While I am lying on the grass<br>
        Thy twofold shout I hear;<br>
        From hill to hill it seems to pass,<br>
        At once far off and near.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though babbling only to the vale<br>
        Of sunshine and of flowers,<br>
        Thou bringest unto me a tale<br>
        Of visionary hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!<br>
        Even yet thou art to me<br>
        No bird, but an invisible thing,<br>
        A voice, a mystery;
      </p>

      <p>
        The same whom in my school-boy days<br>
        I listen’d to; that Cry<br>
        Which made me look a thousand ways<br>
        In bush, and tree, and sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        To seek thee did I often rove<br>
        Through woods and on the green;<br>
        And thou wert still a hope, a love;<br>
        Still long’d for, never seen!
      </p>

      <p>
        And I can listen to thee yet;<br>
        Can lie upon the plain<br>
        And listen, till I do beget<br>
        That golden time again.
      </p>

      <p>
        O blesséd Bird! the earth we pace<br>
        Again appears to be<br>
        An unsubstantial, fairy place,<br>
        That is fit home for Thee!
      </p>

      <h2>The Green Linnet</h2>

      <p>
        BENEATH these fruit-tree boughs that shed<br>
        Their snow-white blossoms on my head,<br>
        With brightest sunshine round me spread<br>
        Of Spring’s unclouded weather,<br>
        In this sequester’d nook how sweet<br>
        To sit upon my orchard-seat!<br>
        And flowers and birds once more to greet,<br>
        My last year’s friends together.
      </p>

      <p>
        One have I mark’d, the happiest guest<br>
        In all this covert of the blest:<br>
        Hail to Thee, far above the rest<br>
        In joy of voice and pinion!<br>
        Thou, Linnet! in thy green array<br>
        Presiding Spirit here to-day<br>
        Dost lead the revels of the May,<br>
        And this is thy dominion.
      </p>

      <p>
        While birds, and butterflies, and flowers,<br>
        Make all one band of paramours,<br>
        Thou, ranging up and down the bowers<br>
        Art sole in thy employment;<br>
        A Life, a Presence like the air,<br>
        Scattering thy gladness without care,<br>
        Too blest with any one to pair,<br>
        Thyself thy own enjoyment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amid yon tuft of hazel trees<br>
        That twinkle to the gusty breeze,<br>
        Behold him perch’d in ecstasies<br>
        Yet seeming still to hover;<br>
        There, where the flutter of his wings<br>
        Upon his back and body flings<br>
        Shadows and sunny glimmerings,<br>
        That cover him all over.
      </p>

      <p>
        My dazzled sight he oft deceives—<br>
        A brother of the dancing leaves;<br>
        Then flits, and from the cottage-eaves<br>
        Pours forth his song in gushes,<br>
        As if by that exulting strain<br>
        He mock’d and treated with disdain<br>
        The voiceless Form he chose to feign,<br>
        While fluttering in the bushes.
      </p>

      <h2>Written in Early Spring</h2>

      <p>
        I HEARD a thousand blended notes<br>
        While in a grove I sate reclined,<br>
        In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br>
        Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        To her fair works did Nature link<br>
        The human soul that through me ran;<br>
        And much it grieved my heart to think<br>
        What Man has made of Man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,<br>
        The periwinkle trail’d its wreaths;<br>
        And ’tis my faith that every flower<br>
        Enjoys the air it breathes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The birds around me hopp’d and play’d,<br>
        Their thoughts I cannot measure,—<br>
        But the least motion which they made<br>
        It seem’d a thrill of pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        The budding twigs spread out their fan<br>
        To catch the breezy air;<br>
        And I must think, do all I can,<br>
        That there was pleasure there.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this belief from heaven be sent,<br>
        If such be Nature’s holy plan,<br>
        Have I not reason to lament<br>
        What Man has made of Man?
      </p>

      <h2>To the Skylark</h2>

      <p>
        ETHEREAL minstrel! pilgrim of the sky!<br>
        Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound?<br>
        Or while the wings aspire, are heart and eye<br>
        Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground?<br>
        Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,<br>
        Those quivering wings composed, that music still!
      </p>

      <p>
        To the last point of vision, and beyond<br>
        Mount, daring warbler!—that love-prompted strain<br>
        —’Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond—<br>
        Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain:<br>
        Yet might’st thou seem, proud privilege! to sing<br>
        All independent of the leafy Spring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leave to the nightingale her shady wood;<br>
        A privacy of glorious light is thine,<br>
        Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood<br>
        Of harmony, with instinct more divine;<br>
        Type of the wise, who soar, but never roam—<br>
        True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home.
      </p>

      <h2>The Affliction of Margaret</h2>

      <p>
        WHERE art thou, my beloved Son,<br>
        Where art thou, worse to me than dead!<br>
        O find me, prosperous or undone!<br>
        Or if the grave be now thy bed,<br>
        Why am I ignorant of the same<br>
        That I may rest; and neither blame<br>
        Nor sorrow may attend thy name?
      </p>

      <p>
        Seven years, alas! to have received<br>
        No tidings of an only child—<br>
        To have despair’d, have hoped, believed,<br>
        And been for evermore beguiled,—<br>
        Sometimes with thoughts of very bliss!<br>
        I catch at them, and then I miss;<br>
        Was ever darkness like to this?
      </p>

      <p>
        He was among the prime in worth,<br>
        An object beauteous to behold;<br>
        Well born, well bred; I sent him forth<br>
        Ingenuous, innocent, and bold:<br>
        If things ensued that wanted grace<br>
        As hath been said, they were not base;<br>
        And never blush was on my face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah! little doth the young-one dream<br>
        When full of play and childish cares,<br>
        What power is in his wildest scream<br>
        Heard by his mother unawares!<br>
        He knows it not, he cannot guess;<br>
        Years to a mother bring distress,<br>
        But do not make her love the less.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neglect me! no, I suffer’d long<br>
        From that ill thought; and being blind<br>
        Said ‘Pride shall help me in my wrong:<br>
        Kind mother have I been, as kind<br>
        As ever breathed:’ and that is true;<br>
        I’ve wet my path with tears like dew,<br>
        Weeping for him when no one knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Son, if thou be humbled, poor,<br>
        Hopeless of honour and of gain,<br>
        O! do not dread thy mother’s door;<br>
        Think not of me with grief and pain:<br>
        I now can see with better eyes;<br>
        And worldly grandeur I despise<br>
        And fortune with her gifts and lies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alas! the fowls of heaven have wings,<br>
        And blasts of heaven will aid their flight;<br>
        They mount—how short a voyage brings<br>
        The wanderers back to their delight!<br>
        Chains tie us down by land and sea;<br>
        And wishes, vain as mine, may be<br>
        All that is left to comfort thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps some dungeon hears thee groan<br>
        Maim’d, mangled by inhuman men;<br>
        Or thou upon a desert thrown<br>
        Inheritest the lion’s den;<br>
        Or hast been summon’d to the deep<br>
        Thou, thou, and all thy mates, to keep<br>
        An incommunicable sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        I look for ghosts; but none will force<br>
        Their way to me: ’tis falsely said<br>
        That there was ever intercourse<br>
        Between the living and the dead;<br>
        For surely then I should have sight<br>
        Of him I wait for day and night<br>
        With love and longings infinite.
      </p>

      <p>
        My apprehensions come in crowds;<br>
        I dread the rustling of the grass;<br>
        The very shadows of the clouds<br>
        Have power to shake me as they pass;<br>
        I question things, and do not find<br>
        One that will answer to my mind;<br>
        And all the world appears unkind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond participation lie<br>
        My troubles, and beyond relief:<br>
        If any chance to heave a sigh<br>
        They pity me, and not my grief.<br>
        Then come to me, my Son, or send<br>
        Some tidings that my woes may end!<br>
        I have no other earthly friend.
      </p>

      <h2>Simon Lee the Old Huntsman</h2>

      <p>
        IN the sweet shire of Cardigan,<br>
        Not far from pleasant Ivor Hall,<br>
        An old man dwells, a little man,<br>
        I’ve heard he once was tall.<br>
        Full five-and-thirty years he lived<br>
        A running huntsman merry;<br>
        And still the centre of his cheek<br>
        Is red as a ripe cherry.
      </p>

      <p>
        No man like him the horn could sound,<br>
        And hill and valley rang with glee,<br>
        When Echo bandied, round and round,<br>
        The halloo of Simon Lee.<br>
        In those proud days he little cared<br>
        For husbandry of or tillage;<br>
        To blither tasks did Simon rouse<br>
        The sleepers of the village.
      </p>

      <p>
        He all the country could outrun,<br>
        Could leave both man and horse behind;<br>
        And often, ere the chase was done,<br>
        He reel’d and was stone-blind.<br>
        And still there’s something in the world<br>
        At which his heart rejoices;<br>
        For when the chiming hounds are out,<br>
        He dearly loves their voices.
      </p>

      <p>
        But O the heavy change!—bereft<br>
        Of health, strength, friends and kindred; see<br>
        Old Simon to the world is left<br>
        In liveried poverty:<br>
        His master’s dead, and no one now<br>
        Dwells in the Hall of Ivor;<br>
        Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;<br>
        He is the sole survivor.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he is lean and he is sick,<br>
        His body, dwindled and awry,<br>
        Rests upon ankles swoln and thick;<br>
        His legs are thin and dry.<br>
        He has no son, he has no child,<br>
        His wife, an aged woman,<br>
        Lives with him, near the waterfall,<br>
        Upon the village common.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,<br>
        Not twenty paces from the door,<br>
        A scrap of land they have, but they<br>
        Are poorest of the poor.<br>
        This scrap of land he from the heath<br>
        Enclosed when he was stronger;<br>
        But what avails the land to them<br>
        Which he can till no longer?
      </p>

      <p>
        Oft, working by her husband’s side,<br>
        Ruth does what Simon cannot do;<br>
        For she, with scanty cause for pride,<br>
        Is stouter of the two.<br>
        And, though you with your utmost skill<br>
        From labour could not wean them,<br>
        ’Tis little, very little, all<br>
        That they can do between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Few months of life has he in store<br>
        As he to you will tell,<br>
        For still, the more he works, the more<br>
        Do his weak ankles swell.<br>
        My gentle reader, I perceive<br>
        How patiently you’ve waited,<br>
        And now I fear that you expect<br>
        Some tale will be related.
      </p>

      <p>
        O reader! had you in your mind<br>
        Such stores as silent thought can bring,<br>
        O gentle reader! you would find<br>
        A tale in everything.<br>
        What more I have to say is short,<br>
        And you must kindly take it:<br>
        It is no tale; but, should you think,<br>
        Perhaps a tale you’ll make it.
      </p>

      <p>
        One summer-day I chanced to see<br>
        This old man doing all he could<br>
        To unearth the root of an old tree,<br>
        A stump of rotten wood.<br>
        The mattock totter’d in his hand;<br>
        So vain was his endeavour<br>
        That at the root of the old tree<br>
        He might have work’d for ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘You’re overtask’d, good Simon Lee,<br>
        Give me your tool,’ to him I said;<br>
        And at the word right gladly he<br>
        Received my proffer’d aid.<br>
        I struck, and with a single blow<br>
        The tangled root I sever’d,<br>
        At which the poor old man so long<br>
        And vainly had endeavour’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tears into his eyes were brought,<br>
        And thanks and praises seem’d to run<br>
        So fast out of his heart, I thought<br>
        They never would have done.<br>
        —I’ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds<br>
        With coldness still returning;<br>
        Alas! the gratitude of men<br>
        Hath oftener left me mourning.

      <h2>Ode to Duty</h2>

      <p>
        STERN Daughter of the voice of God!<br>
          O Duty! if that name thou love<br>
          Who art a light to guide, a rod<br>
          To check the erring, and reprove;<br>
          Thou who art victory and law<br>
          When empty terrors overawe;<br>
          From vain temptations dost set free,<br>
        And calm’st the weary strife of frail humanity!
      </p>

      <p>
        There are who ask not if thine eye<br>
        Be on them; who, in love and truth<br>
        Where no misgiving is, rely<br>
        Upon the genial sense of youth:<br>
        Glad hearts! without reproach or blot,<br>
        Who do thy work, and know it not:<br>
        O! if through confidence misplaced<br>
      They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Serene will be our days and bright<br>
        And happy will our nature be<br>
        When love is an unerring light,<br>
        And joy its own security.<br>
        And they a blissful course may hold<br>
        Ev’n now, who, not unwisely bold,<br>
        Live in the spirit of this creed;<br>
      Yet find that other strength according to their need.
      </p>

      <p>
        I, loving freedom, and untried,<br>
        No sport of every random gust,<br>
        Yet being to myself a guide,<br>
        Too blindly have reposed my trust:<br>
        And oft, when in my heart was heard<br>
        Thy timely mandate, I deferr’d<br>
        The task, in smoother walks to stray;<br>
      But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through no disturbance of my soul<br>
        Or strong compunction in me wrought,<br>
        I supplicate for thy controul,<br>
        But in the quietness of thought:<br>
        Me this uncharter’d freedom tires;<br>
        I feel the weight of chance-desires:<br>
        My hopes no more must change their name;<br>
      I long for a repose that ever is the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear<br>
        The Godhead’s most benignant grace;<br>
        Nor know we anything so fair<br>
        As is the smile upon thy face:<br>
        Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,<br>
        And fragrance in thy footing treads;<br>
        Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong;<br>
      And the most ancient Heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.
      </p>

      <p>
        To humbler functions, awful Power!<br>
        I call thee: I myself commend<br>
        Unto thy guidance from this hour;<br>
        O let my weakness have an end!<br>
        Give unto me, made lowly wise,<br>
        The spirit of self-sacrifice;<br>
        The confidence of reason give;<br>
      And in the light of Truth thy bondman let me live.
      </p>

      <h2>She Was a Phantom of Delight</h2>

      <p>
        SHE was a phantom of delight<br>
        When first she gleam’d upon my sight;<br>
        A lovely apparition, sent<br>
        To be a moment’s ornament;<br>
        Her eyes as stars of twilight fair;<br>
        Like Twilight’s, too, her dusky hair;<br>
        But all things else about her drawn<br>
        From May-time and the cheerful dawn;<br>
        A dancing shape, an image gay,<br>
        To haunt, to startle, and waylay.
      </p>

      <p>
        I saw her upon nearer view,<br>
        A spirit, yet a woman too!<br>
        Her household motions light and free,<br>
        And steps of virgin-liberty;<br>
        A countenance in which did meet<br>
        Sweet records, promises as sweet;<br>
        A creature not too bright or good<br>
        For human nature’s daily food,<br>
        For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br>
        Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now I see with eye serene<br>
        The very pulse of the machine;<br>
        A being breathing thoughtful breath,<br>
        A traveller between life and death:<br>
        The reason firm, the temperate will,<br>
        Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;<br>
        A perfect woman, nobly plann’d<br>
        To warn, to comfort, and command;<br>
        And yet a Spirit still, and bright<br>
        With something of angelic light.
