    <article>
      <p>
        Hither and not unsummoned have I come; <br>
  For a new rumour, borne by stranger men<br>
  Arriving hither, hath attained mine ears.<br>
  Of hap unwished-for, even Orestes’ death.<br>
  This were new sorrow, a blood-bolter’s load<br>
  Laid on the house that doth already bow<br>
  Beneath a former wound that festers deep.<br>
  Dare I opine these words have truth and life?<br>
  Or are they tales, of woman’s terror born,<br>
  That fly in the void air, and die disproved?<br>
  Canst thou tell aught, and prove it to my soul?
      </p>


      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        What we have heard, we heard; go thou within<br>
        Thyself to ask the strangers of their tale.<br>
        Strengthless are tidings, thro’ another heard;<br>
        Question is his to whom the tale is brought.
      </p>

      <h3>ÆGISTHUS</h3>

      <p>
        I too will meet and test the messenger,<br>
        Whether himself stood witness of the death<br>
        Or tells it merely from dim rumour learnt:<br>
        None shall cheat me, whose soul hath watchful eyes.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Zeus, Zeus! what word to me is given?<br>
        What cry or prayer, invoking heaven,<br>
            Shall first by me be uttered?<br>
        What speech of craft—nor all revealing,<br>
        Nor all too warily concealing—<br>
            Ending my speech, shall aid the deed?<br>
        For lo! in readiness is laid<br>
        The dark emprise, the rending blade;<br>
            Blood-dropping daggers shall achieve<br>
        The dateless doom of Atreus’ name,<br>
        Or—kindling torch and joyful flame<br>
          In sign of new-won liberty—<br>
            Once more Orestes shall retrieve<br>
          His father’s wealth, and throned on high,<br>
          Shall hold the city’s fealty.<br>
          So mighty is the grasp whereby,<br>
        Heaven-holpen, he shall trip and throw<br>
        Unseconded, a double foe.<br>
              Ho for the victory!  [A loud cry within.]
      </p>

      <h3>VOICE OF ÆGISTHUS</h3>

      <p>
        Help, help, alas!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Ho there, ho! how is’t within?<br>
        Is’t done? is’t over? Stand we here aloof<br>
        While it is wrought, that guiltless we may seem<br>
        Of this dark deed; with death is strife fulfilled. [Enter a slave.]
      </p>

      <h3>SLAVE</h3>

      <p>
        O woe, O woe, my lord is done to death!<br>
        Woe, woe, and again, Ægisthus gone!<br>
        Hasten, fling wide the doors, unloose the bolts<br>
        Of the queen’s chamber. O for some young strength<br>
        To match the need! but aid availeth nought<br>
        To him laid low for ever. Help, help, help!<br>
        Sure to deaf ears I shout, and call in vain<br>
        To slumber ineffectual. What ho!<br>
        The queen! how fareth Clytemnestra’s self?<br>
        Her neck too, hers, is close upon the steel,<br>
        And soon shall sink, hewn thro’ as justice wills.  [Enter Clytemnestra.]
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        What ails thee, raising this ado for us?
      </p>

      <h3>SLAVE</h3>

      <p>
        I say the dead are come to slay the living.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Alack, I read thy riddles all to clear—<br>
        We slew by craft and by like craft shall die.<br>
        Swift, bring the axe that slew my lord of old;<br>
        I’ll know anon or death or victory—<br>
        So stands the curse, so I confront it here.  [Enter Orestes, his sword dropping with blood.]
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Thee too I seek: for him what’s done will serve.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Woe, woe! Ægisthus, spouse and champion, slain!
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        What, lov’st the man? then in his grave lie down,<br>
        Be his in death, desert him nevermore!
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Stay, child, and fear to strike, O son, this breast<br>
        Pillowed thine head full oft, while, drowsed with sleep,<br>
        Thy toothless mouth drew mother’s milk from me.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Can I my mother spare? speak, Pylades.
      </p>

      <h3>PYLADES</h3>

      <p>
        Where then would fall the hest Apollo gave<br>
        At Delphi, where the solemn compact sworn?<br>
        Choose thou the hate of all men, not of gods.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Thou dost prevail; I hold thy counsel good.  [To Clytemnestra.]<br>
        Follow; I will to slay thee at his side.<br>
        With him whom in his life thou lovedst more<br>
        Than Agamemnon, sleep in death, the meed<br>
        For hate where love, and love where hate was due!
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        I nursed thee young; must I forego mine eld?
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Thou slew’st my father; shalt thou dwell with me?
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Fate bore a share in these things, O my child!
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Fate also doth provide this doom for thee.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Beware, O child, a parent’s dying curse.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        A parent who did cast me out to ill!
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Not cast thee out, but to a friendly home.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Born free, I was by twofold bargain sold.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Where then the price that I received for thee?
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        The price of shame; I taunt thee not more plainly.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Nay, but recount thy father’s lewdness too.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        keeping, chide not him who toils without.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        ’Tis hard for wives to live as widows, child.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        The absent husband toils for them at home.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Thou growest fain to slay thy mother, child.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Nay, ’tis thyself wilt slay thyself, not I.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Beware thy mother’s vengeful hounds from hell.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        How shall I ’scape my father’s, sparing thee?
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Living, I cry as to a tomb, unheard.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        My father’s fate ordains this doom for thee.
      </p>

      <h3>CLYTEMNESTRA</h3>

      <p>
        Ah, me! this snake it was I bore and nursed.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Ay, right prophetic was thy visioned fear.<br>
        Shameful thy deed was—die the death of shame!  [Exit, driving Clytemnestra before him.]
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Lo, even for these I mourn, a double death:<br>
        Yet since Orestes, driven on by doom,<br>
        Thus crowns the height of murders manifold,<br>
        I say, ’tis well that not in night and death<br>
        Should sink the eye and light of this our home.
      </p>

      <p>
        There came on Priam’s race and name<br>
          A vengeance; though it tarried long,<br>
            With heavy doom it came.<br>
        Came, too, on Agamemnon’s hall<br>
            A lion-pair, twin swordsmen strong.<br>
        And last, the heritage doth fall<br>
          To him to whom from Pythian cave<br>
          The god his deepest counsel gave.<br>
        Cry out, rejoice! our kingly hall<br>
            Hath ’scaped from ruin—ne’er again<br>
        Its ancient wealth be wasted all<br>
              By two usurpers, is sin-defiled—<br>
            An evil path of woe and bane!<br>
        On him who dealt the dastard blow<br>
            Comes Craft, Revenge’s scheming child.<br>
        And hand in hand with him doth go,<br>
                  Eager for fight,<br>
        The child of Zeus, whom men below<br>
          Call Justice, naming her aright.<br>
                And on her foes her breath<br>
                Is as the blast of death;<br>
        For her the god who dwells in deep recess<br>
                Beneath Parnassus’ brow,<br>
              Summons with loud acclaim<br>
              To rise, though late and lame,<br>
        And come with craft that worketh righteousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        For even o’er powers divine this law is strong—<br>
              Thou shalt not serve the wrong.<br>
        To that which ruleth heaven beseems it that we bow.<br>
              Lo, freedom’s light hath come!<br>
                Lo, now is rent away<br>
        The grim and curbing bit that held us dumb.<br>
          Up to the light, ye halls! this many a day<br>
                Too low on earth ye lay.<br>
          And Time, the great Accomplisher,<br>
          Shall cross the threshold, whensoe’er<br>
          He choose with purging hand to cleanse<br>
          The palace, driving all pollution thence.<br>
          And fair the cast of Fortune’s die<br>
          Before our state’s new lords shall lie,<br>
          Not as of old, but bringing fairer doom.<br>
              Lo, freedom’s light hath come!  [The scene opens, disclosing Orestes standing over the corpses of Ægisthus and Clytemnestra; in one hand he holds his sword, in the other the robe in which Agamemnon was entangled and slain.]
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        There lies our country’s twofold tyranny,<br>
        My father’s slayers, spoilers of my home.<br>
        Erst were they royal, sitting on the throne,<br>
        And loving are they yet,—their common fate<br>
        Tells the tale truly, shows their trothplight firm.<br>
        They swore to work mine ill—starred father’s death,<br>
        They swore to die together; ’tis fulfilled.<br>
          O ye who stand, this great doom’s witnesses,<br>
        Behold this too, the dark device which bound<br>
        My sire unhappy to his death,—behold<br>
        The mesh which trapped his hands, enwound his feet!<br>
        Stand round, unfold it—’tis the trammel—net<br>
        That wrapped a chieftain; hold it that he see,<br>
        The father—not my sire, but he whose eye<br>
        Is judge of all things, the all—seeing Sun!<br>
        Let him behold my mother’s damnèd deed,<br>
        Then let him stand, when need shall be to me,<br>
        Witness that justly I have sought and slain<br>
        My mother; blameless was Ægisthus’ doom—<br>
        He died the death law bids adulterers die.<br>
        But she who plotted this accursed thing<br>
        To slay her lord, by whom she bare beneath<br>
        Her girdle once the burden of her babes,<br>
        Beloved erewhile, now turned to hateful foes—<br>
        What deem ye of her? or what venomed thing,<br>
        Sea-snake or adder, had more power than she<br>
        To poison with a touch the flesh unscarred?<br>
        So great her daring, such her impious will.<br>
        How name her, if I may not speak a curse?<br>
        A lion-springe! a laver’s swathing cloth,<br>
        Wrapping a dead man, twining round his feet—<br>
        A net, a trammel, an entangling robe?<br>
        Such were the weapon of some strangling thief,<br>
        The terror of the road, a cut-purse hound—<br>
        With such device full many might he kill,<br>
        Full oft exult in heat of villainy.<br>
        Ne’er have my house so cursed an indweller—<br>
        Heaven send me, rather, childless to be slain!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Woe for each desperate deed!<br>
        Woe for the queen, with shame of life bereft!<br>
        And ah, for him who still is left,<br>
        Madness, dark blossom of a bloody seed!
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Did she the deed or not? this robe gives proof,<br>
        Imbrued with blood that bathed Ægisthus’ sword:<br>
        Look, how the spurted stain combines with time<br>
        To blur the many dyes that once adorned<br>
        Its pattern manifold! I now stand here,<br>
        Made glad, made sad with blood, exulting, wailing—<br>
        Hear, O thou woven web that slew my sire!<br>
        I grieve for deed and death and all my home—<br>
        Victor, pollution’s damnèd stain for prize.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Alas, that none of mortal men<br>
        Can pass his life untouched by pain!<br>
        Behold, one woe is here—<br>
        Another loometh near.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Hark ye and learn—for what the end shall be<br>
        For me I know not: breaking from the curb,<br>
        My spirit whirls me off, a conquered prey,<br>
        Borne as a charioteer by steeds distraught<br>
        Far from the course, and madness in my breast<br>
        Burneth to chant its song, and leap, and rave—<br>
        Hark ye and learn, friends, ere my reason goes!<br>
        I say that rightfully I slew my mother,<br>
        A thing God-scorned, that foully slew my sire.<br>
        And chiefest wizard of the spell that bound me<br>
        Unto this deed I name the Pythian seer<br>
        Apollo, who foretold that if I slew,<br>
        The guilt of murder done should pass from me;<br>
        But if I spared, the fate that should be mine<br>
        I dare not blazon forth—the bow of speech<br>
        Can reach not to the mark, that doom to tell.<br>
        And now behold me, how with branch and crown<br>
        I pass, a suppliant made meet to go<br>
        Unto Earth’s midmost shrine, the holy ground<br>
        Of Loxias, and that renowned light<br>
        Of ever-burning fire, to ’scape the doom<br>
        Of kindred murder: to no other shrine<br>
        (So Loxias bade) may I for refuge turn.<br>
        Bear witness, Argives, in the aftertime,<br>
        How came on me this dread fatality.<br>
        Living, I pass a banished wanderer hence,<br>
        To leave in death the memory of this cry.
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Nay, but the deed is well; link not thy lips<br>
        To speech ill-starred, nor vent ill-boding words—<br>
        Who hast to Argos her full freedom given,<br>
        Lopping two serpents’ heads with timely blow.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Look, look, alas!<br>
        Handmaidens, see—what Gorgon shapes throng up,<br>
        Dusky their robes and all their hair enwound—<br>
        Snakes coiled with snakes—off, off, I must away!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Most loyal of all sons unto thy sire,<br>
        What visions thus distract thee? Hold, abide;<br>
        Great was thy victory, and shalt thou fear?
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        These are no dreams, void shapes of haunting ill,<br>
        But clear to sight my mother’s hell-hounds come!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Nay, the fresh bloodshed still imbrues thine hands,<br>
        And thence distraction sinks into thy soul.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        O king Apollo—see, they swarm and throng—<br>
        Black blood of hatred dripping from their eyes!
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        One remedy thou hast; go, touch the shrine<br>
        Of Loxias, and rid thee of these woes.
      </p>

      <h3>ORESTES</h3>

      <p>
        Ye can behold them not, but I behold them.<br>
        Up and away! I dare abide no more.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <h3>CHORUS</h3>

      <p>
        Farewell than as thou mayst,—the god thy friend<br>
        Guard thee and aid with chances favouring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behold, the storm of woe divine<br>
        That raves and beats on Atreus’ line<br>
          Its great third blast hath blown.<br>
        First was Thyestes’ loathly woe—<br>
        The rueful feast of long ago,<br>
          On children’s flesh, unknown.<br>
        And next the kingly chief’s despite,<br>
        When he who led the Greeks to fight<br>
          Was in the bath hewn down.<br>
        And now the offspring of the race<br>
        Stands in the third, the saviour’s place,<br>
          To save—or to consume?<br>
        O whither, ere it be fulfilled,<br>
        Ere its fierce blast be hushed and stilled,<br>
          Shall blow the wind of doom?  [Exeunt.]
