      <h2>Inferno [Hell]</h2>

      <h2>Canto VIII</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—A signal having been made from the tower, Phlegyas, the ferryman of the lake, speedily crosses it, and conveys Virgil and Dante to the other side. On their passage, they meet with Filippo Argenti, whose fury and torment are described. They then arrive at the city of Dis, the entrance whereto is denied, and the portals closed against them by many Demons.
      </p>

      <p>
        MY theme pursuing, I relate, that ere <br>
        We reach’d the lofty turret’s base, our eyes<br>
        Its height ascended, where we mark’d uphung<br>
        Two cressets, and another saw from far<br>
        Return the signal, so remote, that scarce<br>
        The eye could catch its beam. I, turning round<br>
        To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquired:<br>
        “Say what this means; and what, that other light<br>
        In answer set: what agency doth this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There on the filthy waters,” he replied,<br>
      “E’en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,<br>
      If the marsh-gendered fog conceal it not.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Never was arrow from the cord dismiss’d,<br>
      That ran its way so nimbly through the air,<br>
      As a small bark, that through the waves I spied<br>
      Toward us coming, under the sole sway<br>
      Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:<br>
      “Art thou arrived, fell spirit?”—“Phlegyas, Phlegyas,<br>
      This time thou criest in vain,” my lord replied;<br>
      “No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er<br>
      The slimy pool we pass.” As one who hears<br>
      Of some great wrong he hath sustain’d, whereat<br>
      Inly he pines: so Phlegyas inly pined<br>
      In his fierce ire. My guide, descending, stepp’d<br>
      Into the skiff, and bade me enter next,<br>
      Close at his side; nor, till my entrance, seem’d<br>
      The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark’d,<br>
      Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,<br>
      More deeply than with others it is wont.
      </p>

      <p>
        While we our course o’er the dead channel held,<br>
      One drench’d in mire before me came, and said:<br>
      “Who art thou, that thus comest ere thine hour?”
      </p>

      <p>
        I answer’d: “Though I come, I tarry not:<br>
      But who art thou, that art become so foul?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “One, as thou seest, who mourn:” he straight replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        To which I thus: “In mourning and in woe,<br>
      Curst spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well,<br>
      E’en thus in filth disguised.” Then stretch’d he forth<br>
      Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage<br>
      Aware, thrusting him back: “Away! down there<br>
      To the other dogs!” then, with his arms my neck<br>
      Encircling, kiss’d my cheek, and spake: “O soul,<br>
      Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom<br>
      Thou wast conceived. He in the world was one<br>
      For arrogance noted: to his memory<br>
      No virtue lends its lustre; even so<br>
      Here is his shadow furious. There above,<br>
      How many now hold themselves mighty kings,<br>
      Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,<br>
      Leaving behind them horrible dispraise.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I then: “Master! him fain would I behold<br>
      Whelm’d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He thus: “Or ever to thy view the shore<br>
      Be offer’d, satisfied shall be that wish,<br>
      Which well deserves completion.” Scarce his words<br>
      Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes<br>
      Set on him with such violence, that yet<br>
      For that render I thanks to God, and praise.<br>
      “To Filippo Argenti!” cried they all:<br>
      And on himself the moody Florentine<br>
      Turn’d his avenging fangs. Him here we left,<br>
      Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear<br>
      Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,<br>
      Whereat mine eye unbarr’d I sent abroad.
      </p>

      <p>
        And thus the good instructor: “Now, my son<br>
      Draws near the city, that of Dis is named,<br>
      With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I thus: “The minarets already, Sir!<br>
      There, certes, in the valley I descry,<br>
      Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire<br>
      Had issued.” He replied: “Eternal fire,<br>
      That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame<br>
      Illumed; as in this nether Hell thou seest.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We came within the fosses deep, that moat<br>
      This region comfortless. The walls appear’d<br>
      As they were framed of iron. We had made<br>
      Wide circuit, ere a place we reach’d, where loud<br>
      The mariner cried vehement: “Go forth:<br>
      The entrance is here.” Upon the gates I spied<br>
      More than a thousand, who of old from Heaven<br>
      Were shower’d. With ireful gestures, “Who is this,”<br>
      They cried, “that, without death first felt, goes through<br>
      The regions of the dead?” My sapient guide<br>
      Made sign that he for secret parley wish’d;<br>
      Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus<br>
      They spake: “Come thou alone; and let him go,<br>
      Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm.<br>
      Alone return he by his witless way;<br>
      If well he knew it, let him prove. For thee,<br>
      Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark<br>
      Hast been his escort.” Now bethink thee, reader!<br>
      What cheer was mine at sound of those curst words.<br>
      I did believe I never should return.
      </p>

      <p>
        “O my loved guide! who more than seven times<br>
      Security hast render’d me, and drawn<br>
      From peril deep, whereto I stood exposed,<br>
      Desert me not,” I cried, “in this extreme.<br>
      And, if our onward going be denied,<br>
      Together trace we back our steps with speed.”
      </p>

      <p>
        My liege, who thither had conducted me,<br>
      Replied: “Fear not: for of our passage none<br>
      Hath power to disappoint us, by such high<br>
      Authority permitted. But do thou<br>
      Expect me here; meanwhile, thy wearied spirit<br>
      Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assured<br>
      I will not leave thee in this lower world.”<br>
      This said, departs the sire benevolent,<br>
      And quits me. Hesitating I remain<br>
      At war, ’twixt will and will not, in my thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I could not hear what terms he offer’d them,<br>
      But they conferr’d not long, for all at once<br>
      Pellmell rush’d back within. Closed were the gates,<br>
      By those our adversaries, on the breast<br>
      Of my liege lord: excluded, he return’d<br>
      To me with tardy steps. Upon the ground<br>
      His eyes were bent, and from his brow erased<br>
      All confidence, while thus in sighs he spake:<br>
      “Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?”<br>
      Then thus to me: “That I am anger’d, think<br>
      No ground of terror: in this trial I<br>
      Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within<br>
      For hindrance. This their insolence, not new,<br>
      Erewhile at gate less secret they display’d,<br>
      Which still is without bolt; upon its arch<br>
      Thou saw’st the deadly scroll: and even now,<br>
      On this side of its entrance, down the steep,<br>
      Passing the circles, unescorted, comes<br>
      One whose strong might can open us this land.”
      </p>

      <h2>Canto IX</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—After some hindrances, and having seen the hellish furies and other monsters, the Poet, by the help of an angel, enters the city of Dis, wherein he discovers that the heretics are punished in tombs burning with intense fire; and he, together with Virgil, passes onward between the sepulchres and the walls of the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        THE HUE, which coward dread on my pale cheeks<br>
        Imprinted when I saw my guide turn back,<br>
        Chased that from his which newly they had worn,<br>
        And inwardly restrain’d it. He, as one<br>
        Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye<br>
        Not far could lead him through the sable air,<br>
        And the thick-gathering cloud. “It yet behoves<br>
        We win this fight;” thus he began: “if not,<br>
        Such aid to us is offer’d—Oh! how long<br>
        Me seems it, ere the promised help arrive.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I noted, how the sequel of his words<br>
      Cloked their beginning; for the last he spake<br>
      Agreed not with the first. But not the less<br>
      My fear was at his saying; sith I drew<br>
      To import worse, perchance, than that he held,<br>
      His mutilated speech. “Doth ever any<br>
      Into this rueful concave’s extreme depth<br>
      Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain<br>
      Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus I inquiring. “Rarely,” he replied,<br>
      “It chances, that among us any makes<br>
      This journey, which I wend. Erewhile, ’tis true,<br>
      Once came I here beneath, conjured by fell<br>
      Erichtho, sorceress, who compell’d the shades<br>
      Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh<br>
      Was naked of me, when within these walls<br>
      She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit<br>
      From out of Judas’ circle. Lowest place<br>
      Is that of all, obscurest, and removed<br>
      Farthest from Heaven’s all-circling orb. The road<br>
      Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.<br>
      That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round<br>
      The city of grief encompasses, which now<br>
      We may not enter without rage, “Yet more<br>
      He added: but I hold it not in mind,<br>
      For that mine eye toward the lofty tower<br>
      Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top;<br>
      Where, in an instant, I beheld uprisen<br>
      At once three hellish furies stain’d with blood.<br>
      In limb and motion feminine they seem’d;<br>
      Around them greenest hydras twisting roll’d<br>
      Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept<br>
      Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.
      </p>

      <p>
        He, knowing well the miserable hags<br>
      Who tend the queen of endless owe, thus spake:<br>
      “Mark thou each dire Erynnis. To the left,<br>
      This is Megæra; on the right hand, she<br>
      Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone<br>
      I’ th’ midst.” This said, in silence he remain’d.<br>
      Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves<br>
      Smote with their palms, and such thrill clamour raised,<br>
      That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.<br>
      “Hasten Medusa: so to adamant<br>
      Him shall we change;” all looking down exclaim’d:<br>
      “E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took<br>
      No ill revenge.” “Turn thyself round and keep<br>
      Thy countenance hid; for if the Gorgon dire<br>
      Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return<br>
      Upwards would be forever lost.” This said,<br>
      Himself, my gentle master, turn’d me round;<br>
      Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own<br>
      He also hid me. Ye of intellect<br>
      Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal’d<br>
      Under close texture of the mystic strain.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now there came o’er the perturbed waves<br>
      Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made<br>
      Either shore tremble, as if of a wind<br>
      Impetuous, from conflicting vapors sprung,<br>
      That ’gainst some forest driving all his might,<br>
      Plucks off the branches, beats them down, and hurls<br>
      Afar; then, onward passing, proudly sweeps<br>
      His whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mine eyes he loosed, and spake: “And now direct<br>
      Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,<br>
      There, thickest where the smoke ascends.” As frogs<br>
      Before their foe the serpent, through the wave<br>
      Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one<br>
      Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits<br>
      Destroy’d, so saw I fleeing before one<br>
      Who pass’d with unwet feet the Stygian sound.<br>
      He, from his face removing the gross air,<br>
      Oft his left hand forth stretch’d, and seem’d alone<br>
      By that annoyance wearied. I perceived<br>
      That he was sent from Heaven; and to my guide<br>
      Turn’d me, who signal made, that I should stand<br>
      Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full<br>
      Of noble anger seem’d he. To the gate<br>
      He came, and with his wand touch’d it, whereat<br>
      Open without impediment it flew.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Outcasts of heaven! O abject race, scorn’d!”<br>
      Began he, on the horrid grunsel standing,<br>
      “Whence doth this wild excess of insolence<br>
      Lodge in you? wherefore kick you ’gainst that will<br>
      Ne’er frustrate of its end, and which so oft<br>
      Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?<br>
      What profits at the Fates to butt the horn?<br>
      Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence<br>
      Bears still, peel’d of their hair, his throat and maw.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This said, he turn’d back o’er the filthy way,<br>
      And syllable to us spake none; but wore<br>
      The semblance of a man by other care<br>
      Beset, and keenly prest, than thought of him<br>
      Who in his presence stands. Then we our steps<br>
      Toward that territory moved, secure<br>
      After the hallow’d words. We, unopposed,<br>
      There enter’d; and, my mind eager to learn<br>
      What state a fortress like to that might hold,<br>
      I, soon as enter’d, throw mine eye around,<br>
      And see, on every part, wide-stretching space,<br>
      Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,<br>
      Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro’s gulf,<br>
      That closes Italy and laves her bounds,<br>
      The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;<br>
      So was it here, save what in horror here<br>
      Excell’d: for ’midst the graves were scattered flames,<br>
      Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d,<br>
      That iron for no craft there hotter needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their lids all hung suspended; and beneath,<br>
      From them forth issued lamentable moans,<br>
      Such as the sad and tortured well might raise.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thus: “Master! say who are these, interr’d<br>
      Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear<br>
      The dolorous sighs.” He answer thus return’d:<br>
      “The arch-heretics are here, accompanied<br>
      By every sect their followers; and much more<br>
      Than thou believest, the tombs are freighted: like<br>
      With like is buried; and the monuments<br>
      Are different in degrees of heat.” This said,<br>
      He to the right hand turning, on we pass’d<br>
      Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.
