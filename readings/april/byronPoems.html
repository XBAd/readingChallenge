      <h2>The Prisoner of Chillon</h2>

      <p>
        MY hair is gray, but not with years, <br>
          Nor grew it white<br>
          In a single night,<br>
        As men’s have grown from sudden fears;<br>
        My limbs are bow’d, though not with toil,<br>
        But rusted with a vile repose,<br>
        For they have been a dungeon’s spoil,<br>
        And mine has been the fate of those<br>
        To whom the goodly earth and air<br>
        Are bann’d, and barr’d—forbidden fare;<br>
        But this was for my father’s faith<br>
        I suffer’d chains and courted death;<br>
        That father perish’d at the stake<br>
        For tenets he would not forsake;<br>
        And for the same his lineal race<br>
        In darkness found a dwelling-place.<br>
        We were seven—who now are one,<br>
          Six in youth, and one in age,<br>
        Finish’d as they had begun,<br>
          Proud of Persecution’s rage;<br>
        One in fire, and two in field<br>
        Their belief with blood have seal’d,<br>
        Dying as their father died,<br>
        For the God their foes denied;<br>
        Three were in a dungeon cast,<br>
        Of whom this wreck is left the last.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,<br>
        In Chillon’s dungeons deep and old,<br>
        There are seven columns, massy and gray,<br>
        Dim with a dull imprison’d ray,<br>
        A sunbeam which hath lost its way,<br>
        And through the crevice and the cleft<br>
        Of the thick wall is fallen and left;<br>
        Creeping o’er the floor so damp,<br>
        Like a marsh’s meteor lamp.<br>
        And in each pillar there is a ring,<br>
          And in each ring there is a chain;<br>
        That iron is a cankering thing,<br>
          For in these limbs its teeth remain,<br>
        With marks that will not wear away,<br>
        Till I have done with this new day,<br>
        Which now is painful to these eyes,<br>
        Which have not seen the sun so rise<br>
        For years—I cannot count them o’er,<br>
        I lost their long and heavy score,<br>
        When my last brother droop’d and died,<br>
        And I lay living by his side.
      </p>

      <p>
        They chain’d us each to a column stone,<br>
        And we were three—yet, each alone;<br>
        We could not move a single pace,<br>
        We could not see each other’s face,<br>
        But with that pale and livid light<br>
        That made us strangers in our sight:<br>
        And thus together—yet apart,<br>
        Fetter’d in hand, but join’d in heart,<br>
        ’Twas still some solace, in the dearth<br>
        Of the pure elements of earth,<br>
        To hearken to each other’s speech,<br>
        And each turn comforter to each<br>
        With some new hope, or legend old,<br>
        Or song heroically bold;<br>
        But even these at length grew cold,<br>
        Our voices took a dreary tone,<br>
        An echo of the dungeon stone,<br>
          A grating sound, not full and free,<br>
          As they of yore were wont to be;<br>
          It might be fancy, but to me<br>
        They never sounded like our own.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was the eldest of the three,<br>
          And to uphold and cheer the rest<br>
          I ought to do—and did my best;<br>
        And each did well in his degree.<br>
          The youngest, whom my father loved,<br>
        Because our mother’s brow was given<br>
        To him, with eyes as blue as heaven—<br>
          For him my soul was sorely moved;<br>
        And truly might it be distress’d<br>
        To see such bird in such a nest;<br>
        For he was beautiful as day<br>
          (When day was beautiful to me<br>
          As to young eagles, being free)—<br>
          A polar day, which will not see<br>
        A sunset till its summer’s gone,<br>
          Its sleepless summer of long light,<br>
        The snow-clad offspring of the sun:<br>
          And thus he was as pure and bright,<br>
        And in his natural spirit gay,<br>
        With tears for nought but others’ ills;<br>
        And then they flow’d like mountain rills,<br>
        Unless he could assuage the woe<br>
        Which he abhorr’d to view below.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other was as pure of mind,<br>
        But form’d to combat with his kind;<br>
        Strong in his frame, and of a mood<br>
        Which ’gainst the world in war had stood,<br>
        And perish’d in the foremost rank<br>
          With joy:—but not in chains to pine:<br>
        His spirit wither’d with their clank,<br>
          I saw it silently decline—<br>
          And so perchance in sooth did mine:<br>
        But yet I forced it on to cheer<br>
        Those relics of a home so dear.<br>
        He was a hunter of the hills,<br>
          Had follow’d there the deer and wolf;<br>
          To him this dungeon was a gulf,<br>
        And fetter’d feet the worst of ills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lake Leman lies by Chillon’s walls:<br>
      A thousand feet in depth below<br>
      Its massy waters meet and flow;<br>
      Thus much the fathom-line was sent<br>
      From Chillon’s snow-white battlement<br>
        Which round about the wave inthrals:<br>
      A double dungeon wall and wave<br>
      Have made—and like a living grave.<br>
      Below the surface of the lake<br>
      The dark vault lies wherein we lay,<br>
      We heard it ripple night and day;<br>
        Sounding o’er our heads it knock’d;<br>
      And I have felt the winter’s spray<br>
      Wash through the bars when winds were high<br>
      And wanton in the happy sky;<br>
        And then the very rock hath rock’d,<br>
        And I have felt it shake, unshock’d<br>
      Because I could have smiled to see<br>
      The death that would have set me free.
      </p>

      <p>
        I said my nearer brother pined,<br>
        I said his mighty heart declined,<br>
        He loathed and put away his food;<br>
        It was not that ’twas coarse and rude,<br>
        For we were used to hunter’s fare,<br>
        And for the like had little care.<br>
        The milk drawn from the mountain goat<br>
        Was changed for water from the moat,<br>
        Our bread was such as captives’ tears<br>
        Have moistened many a thousand years,<br>
        Since man first pent his fellow men<br>
        Like brutes within an iron den;<br>
        But what were these to us or him?<br>
        These wasted not his heart or limb;<br>
        My brother’s soul was of that mould<br>
        Which in a palace had grown cold,<br>
        Had his free breathing been denied<br>
        The range of the steep mountain’s side.<br>
        But why delay the truth?—he died.<br>
        I saw, and could not hold his head,<br>
        Nor reach his dying hand—nor dead,—<br>
        Though hard I strove, but strove in vain<br>
        To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.<br>
        He died,—and they unlock’d his chain,<br>
        And scoop’d for him a shallow grave<br>
        Even from the cold earth of our cave.<br>
        I begg’d them, as a boon, to lay<br>
        His corse in dust whereon the day<br>
        Might shine—it was a foolish thought,<br>
        But then within my brain it wrought,<br>
        That even in death his freeborn breast<br>
        In such a dungeon could not rest.<br>
        I might have spared my idle prayer;<br>
        They coldly laugh’d—and laid him there:<br>
        The flat and turfless earth above<br>
        The being we so much did love;<br>
        His empty chain above it leant,<br>
        Such murder’s fitting monument!
      </p>

      <p>
        But he, the favourite and the flower,<br>
        Most cherish’d since his natal hour,<br>
        His mother’s image in fair face,<br>
        The infant love of all his race,<br>
        His martyr’d father’s dearest thought,<br>
        My latest care for whom I sought<br>
        To hoard my life, that his might be<br>
        Less wretched now, and one day free;<br>
        He, too, who yet had held untired<br>
        A spirit natural or inspired—<br>
        He, too, was struck, and day by day<br>
        Was wither’d on the stalk away.<br>
        Oh, God! it is a fearful thing<br>
        To see the human soul take wing<br>
        In any shape, in any mood:—<br>
        I’ve seen it rushing forth in blood,<br>
        I’ve seen it on the breaking ocean<br>
        Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,<br>
        I’ve seen the sick and ghastly bed<br>
        Of Sin delirious with its dread:<br>
        But these were horrors—this was woe<br>
        Unmix’d with such—but sure and slow.<br>
        He faded, and so calm and meek,<br>
        So softly worn, so sweetly weak,<br>
        So tearless, yet so tender—kind,<br>
        And grieved for those he left behind;<br>
        With all the while a cheek whose bloom<br>
        Was as a mockery of the tomb,<br>
        Whose tints as gently sunk away<br>
        As a departing rainbow’s ray;<br>
        An eye of most transparent light,<br>
        That almost made the dungeon bright;<br>
        And not a word of murmur, not<br>
        A groan o’er his untimely lot,—<br>
        A little talk of better days,<br>
        A little hope my own to raise,<br>
        For I was sunk in silence—lost<br>
        In this last loss, of all the most;<br>
        And then the sighs he would suppress<br>
        Of fainting nature’s feebleness,<br>
        More slowly drawn, grew less and less.<br>
        I listen’d, but I could not hear—<br>
        I call’d, for I was wild with fear;<br>
        I knew ’t was hopeless, but my dread<br>
        Would not be thus admonishèd.<br>
        I call’d, and thought I heard a sound—<br>
        I burst my chain with one strong bound,<br>
        And rush’d to him:—I found him not,<br>
        I only stirr’d in this black spot,<br>
        I only lived, I only drew<br>
        The accursèd breath of dungeon-dew;<br>
        The last—the sole—the dearest link<br>
        Between me and the eternal brink,<br>
        Which bound me to my failing race,<br>
        Was broken in this fatal place.<br>
        One on the earth, and one beneath—<br>
        My brothers—both had ceased to breathe:<br>
        I took that hand which lay so still,<br>
        Alas! my own was full as chill;<br>
        I had not strength to stir, or strive,<br>
        But felt that I was still alive—<br>
        A frantic feeling, when we know<br>
        That what we love shall ne’er be so.<br>
          I know not why<br>
          I could not die,<br>
        I had no earthly hope—but faith,<br>
        And that forbade a selfish death.
      </p>

      <p>
        What next befell me then and there<br>
          I know not well—I never knew;<br>
        First came the loss of light, and air,<br>
          And then of darkness too:<br>
        I had no thought, no feeling—none—<br>
        Among the stones, I stood a stone,<br>
        And was, scarce conscious what I wist,<br>
        As shrubless crags within the mist;<br>
        For all was blank, and bleak, and gray;<br>
        It was not night—it was not day;<br>
        It was not even the dungeon-light,<br>
        So hateful to my heavy sight,<br>
        But vacancy absorbing space,<br>
        And fixedness—without a place;<br>
        There were no stars, no earth, no time,<br>
        No check, no change, no good, no crime,<br>
        But silence, and a stirless breath<br>
        Which neither was of life nor death;<br>
        A sea of stagnant idleness,<br>
        Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!
      </p>

      <p>
        A light broke in upon my brain,—<br>
          It was the carol of a bird;<br>
        It ceased, and then it came again,<br>
          The sweetest song ear ever heard,<br>
        And mine was thankful till my eyes<br>
        Ran over with the glad surprise,<br>
        And they that moment could not see<br>
        I was the mate of misery.<br>
        But then by dull degrees came back<br>
        My senses to their wonted track;<br>
        I saw the dungeon walls and floor<br>
        Close slowly round me as before,<br>
        I saw the glimmer of the sun<br>
        Creeping as it before had done,<br>
        But through the crevice where it came<br>
        That bird was perched, as fond and tame,<br>
          And tamer than upon the tree;<br>
        A lovely bird, with azure wings,<br>
        And song that said a thousand things,<br>
          And seemed to say them all for me!<br>
        I never saw its like before,<br>
        I ne’er shall see its likeness more;<br>
        It seemed like me to want a mate,<br>
        But was not half so desolate,<br>
        And it was come to love me when<br>
        None lived to love me so again,<br>
        And cheering from my dungeon’s brink,<br>
        Had brought me back to feel and think.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know not if it late were free,<br>
          Or broke its cage to perch on mine,<br>
        But knowing well captivity,<br>
          Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!<br>
        Or if it were, in wingèd guise,<br>
        A visitant from Paradise;<br>
        For—Heaven forgive that thought! the while<br>
        Which made me both to weep and smile—<br>
        I sometimes deem’d that it might be<br>
        My brother’s soul come down to me;<br>
        But then at last away it flew,<br>
        And then ’twas mortal well I knew,<br>
        For he would never thus have flown,<br>
        And left me twice so doubly lone,<br>
        Lone—as the corse within its shroud,<br>
        Lone—as a solitary cloud,<br>
          A single cloud on a sunny day,<br>
        While all the rest of heaven is clear,<br>
        A frown upon the atmosphere<br>
        That hath no business to appear<br>
          When skies are blue and earth is gay.
      </p>

      <p>
        A kind of change came in my fate,<br>
        My keepers grew compassionate;<br>
        I know not what had made them so,<br>
        They were inured to sights of woe,<br>
        But so it was:—my broken chain<br>
        With links unfasten’d did remain,<br>
        And it was liberty to stride<br>
        Along my cell from side to side,<br>
        And up and down, and then athwart,<br>
        And tread it over every part;<br>
        And round the pillars one by one,<br>
        Returning where my walk begun,<br>
        Avoiding only, as I trod,<br>
        My brothers’ graves without a sod;<br>
        For if I thought with heedless tread<br>
        My steps profaned their lowly bed,<br>
        My breath came gaspingly and thick,<br>
        And my crush’d heart fell blind and sick.
      </p>

      <p>
        I made a footing in the wall,<br>
          It was not therefrom to escape,<br>
        For I had buried one and all<br>
          Who loved me in a human shape;<br>
        And the whole earth would henceforth be<br>
        A wider prison unto me:<br>
        No child, no sire, no kin had I,<br>
        No partner in my misery;<br>
        I thought of this, and I was glad,<br>
        For thought of them had made me mad;<br>
        But I was curious to ascend<br>
        To my barr’d windows, and to bend<br>
        Once more, upon the mountains high,<br>
        The quiet of a loving eye.<br>
        I saw them—and they were the same.<br>
        They were not changed like me in frame;<br>
        I saw their thousand years of snow<br>
        On high—their wide long lake below,<br>
        And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;<br>
        I heard the torrents leap and gush<br>
        O’er channell’d rock and broken bush;<br>
        I saw the white-wall’d distant town,<br>
        And whiter sails go skimming down;<br>
        And then there was a little isle,<br>
        Which in my very face did smile,<br>
          The only one in view;<br>
        A small green isle, it seem’d no more,<br>
        Scarce broader than my dungeon floor,<br>
        But in it there were three tall trees,<br>
        And o’er it blew the mountain breeze,<br>
        And by it there were waters flowing,<br>
        And on it there were young flowers growing<br>
          Of gentle breath and hue.<br>
        The fish swam by the castle wall,<br>
        And they seem’d joyous each and all;<br>
        The eagle rode the rising blast,<br>
        Methought he never flew so fast<br>
        As then to me he seem’d to fly;<br>
        And then new tears came in my eye,<br>
        And I felt troubled and would fain<br>
        I had not left my recent chain.<br>
        And when I did descend again,<br>
        The darkness of my dim abode<br>
        Fell on me as a heavy load;<br>
        It was as is a new-dug grave,<br>
        Closing o’er one we sought to save;<br>
        And yet my glance, too much opprest,<br>
        Had almost need of such a rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        It might be months, or years, or days—<br>
          I kept no count, I took no note,<br>
        I had no hope my eyes to raise,<br>
          And clear them of their dreary mote.<br>
        At last men came to set me free;<br>
          I ask’d not why, and reck’d not where,<br>
        It was at length the same to me,<br>
        Fetter’d or fetterless to be,<br>
          I learn’d to love despair.<br>
        And thus when they appear’d at last,<br>
        And all my bonds aside were cast,<br>
        These heavy walls to me had grown<br>
        A hermitage—and all my own!<br>
        And half I felt as they were come<br>
        To tear me from a second home:<br>
        With spiders I had friendship made,<br>
        And watch’d them in their sullen trade,<br>
        Had seen the mice by moonlight play,<br>
        And why should I feel less than they?<br>
        We were all inmates of one place,<br>
        And I, the monarch of each race,<br>
        Had power to kill—yet, strange to tell!<br>
        In quiet we had learn’d to dwell—<br>
        My very chains and I grew friends,<br>
        So much a long communion tends<br>
        To make us what we are:—even I<br>
        Regain’d my freedom with a sigh.
      </p>

      <h2>On the Castle of Chillon</h2>

      <p>
        ETERNAL SPIRIT of the chainless Mind!<br>
        Brightest in dungeons, Liberty, thou art,—<br>
        For there thy habitation is the heart—<br>
        The heart which love of Thee alone can bind;
      </p>

      <p>
        And when thy sons to fetters are consign’d,<br>
        To fetters, and the damp vault’s dayless gloom,<br>
        Their country conquers with their martyrdom,<br>
        And Freedom’s fame finds wings on every wind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chillon! thy prison is a holy place<br>
        And thy sad floor an altar, for ’twas trod,<br>
        Until his very steps have left a trace
      </p>

      <p>
        Worn as if thy cold pavement were a sod,<br>
        By Bonnivard! May none those marks efface!<br>
        For they appeal from tyranny to God.
      </p>

      <h2>Song of Saul Before His Last Battle</h2>

      <p>
        WARRIORS and chiefs! should the shaft or the sword<br>
        Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,<br>
        Heed not the corse, though a king’s in your path:<br>
        Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath!
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou who art bearing my buckler and bow,<br>
        Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe,<br>
        Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet!<br>
        Mine be the doom which they dared not to meet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Farewell to others, but never we part,<br>
        Heir to my royalty, son of my heart!<br>
        Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway,<br>
        Or kingly the death, which awaits us to-day!
      </p>

      <h2>The Isles of Greece</h2>

      <p>
        THE ISLES of Greece! the isles of Greece!<br>
          Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<br>
        Where grew the arts of war and peace,<br>
          Where Delos rose, and Phœbus sprung!<br>
        Eternal summer gilds them yet,<br>
        But all, except their sun, is set.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Scian and the Teian muse,<br>
          The hero’s harp, the lover’s lute,<br>
        Have found the fame your shores refuse:<br>
          Their place of birth alone is mute<br>
        To sounds which echo further west<br>
        Than your sires’ ‘Islands of the Blest.’
      </p>

      <p>
        The mountains look on Marathon—<br>
          And Marathon looks on the sea;<br>
        And musing there an hour alone,<br>
          I dream’d that Greece might still be free;<br>
        For standing on the Persians’ grave,<br>
        I could not deem myself a slave.
      </p>

      <p>
        A king sate on the rocky brow<br>
          Which looks o’er sea-born Salamis;<br>
        And ships, by thousands, lay below,<br>
          And men in nations;—all were his!<br>
        He counted them at break of day—<br>
        And when the sun set, where were they?
      </p>

      <p>
        And where are they? and where art thou,<br>
          My country? On thy voiceless shore<br>
        The heroic lay is tuneless now—<br>
          The heroic bosom beats no more!<br>
        And must thy lyre, so long divine,<br>
        Degenerate into hands like mine?
      </p>

      <p>
        ’Tis something in the dearth of fame,<br>
          Though link’d among a fetter’d race,<br>
        To feel at least a patriot’s shame,<br>
          Even as I sing, suffuse my face;<br>
        For what is left the poet here?<br>
        For Greeks a blush—for Greece a tear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Must we but weep o’er days more blest?<br>
          Must we but blush?—Our fathers bled.<br>
        Earth! render back from out thy breast<br>
          A remnant of our Spartan dead!<br>
        Of the three hundred grant but three,<br>
        To make a new Thermopylæ!
      </p>

      <p>
        What, silent still? and silent all?<br>
          Ah! no;—the voices of the dead<br>
        Sound like a distant torrent’s fall,<br>
          And answer, ‘Let one living head,<br>
        But one, arise,—we come, we come!’<br>
        ’Tis but the living who are dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
        In vain—in vain: strike other chords;<br>
          Fill high the cup with Samian wine!<br>
        Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,<br>
          And shed the blood of Scio’s vine!<br>
        Hark! rising to the ignoble call—<br>
        How answers each bold Bacchanal!
      </p>

      <p>
        You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet;<br>
          Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?<br>
        Of two such lessons, why forget<br>
          The nobler and the manlier one?<br>
        You have the letters Cadmus gave—<br>
        Think ye he meant them for a slave?
      </p>

      <p>
        Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br>
          We will not think of themes like these!<br>
        It made Anacreon’s song divine:<br>
          He served—but served Polycrates—<br>
        A tyrant; but our masters then<br>
        Were still, at least, our countrymen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tyrant of the Chersonese<br>
          Was freedom’s best and bravest friend;<br>
        That tyrant was Miltiades!<br>
          O that the present hour would lend<br>
        Another despot of the kind!<br>
        Such chains as his were sure to bind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br>
          On Suli’s rock, and Parga’s shore,<br>
        Exists the remnant of a line<br>
          Such as the Doric mothers bore;<br>
        And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,<br>
        The Heracleidan blood might own.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trust not for freedom to the Franks—<br>
          They have a king who buys and sells;<br>
        In native swords and native ranks<br>
          The only hope of courage dwells:<br>
        But Turkish force and Latin fraud<br>
        Would break your shield, however broad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br>
          Our virgins dance beneath the shade—<br>
        I see their glorious black eyes shine;<br>
          But gazing on each glowing maid,<br>
        My own the burning tear-drop laves,<br>
        To think such breasts must suckle slaves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Place me on Sunium’s marbled steep,<br>
          Where nothing, save the waves and I,<br>
        May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;<br>
          There, swan-like, let me sing and die:<br>
        A land of slaves shall ne’er be mine—<br>
        Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!
      </p>

      <h2>On This Day I Complete My Thirty-Sixth Year</h2>

      <p>
        ’TIS time this heart should be unmoved,<br>
          Since others it hath ceased to move:<br>
        Yet, though I cannot be beloved,<br>
              Still let me love!
      </p>

      <p>
        My days are in the yellow leaf;<br>
          The flowers and fruits of love are gone;<br>
        The worm, the canker, and the grief<br>
              Are mine alone!
      </p>

      <p>
        The fire that on my bosom preys<br>
          Is lone as some volcanic isle;<br>
        No torch is kindled at its blaze—<br>
              A funeral pile.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hope, the fear, the jealous care,<br>
          The exalted portion of the pain<br>
        And power of love, I cannot share,<br>
              But wear the chain.
      </p>

      <p>
        But ’tis not thus—and ’tis not here—<br>
          Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now,<br>
        Where glory decks the hero’s bier,<br>
              Or binds his brow.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sword, the banner, and the field,<br>
          Glory and Greece, around me see!<br>
        The Spartan, borne upon his shield,<br>
              Was not more free.
      </p>

      <p>
        Awake! (not Greece—she is awake!)<br>
          Awake, my spirit! Think through whom<br>
        Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,<br>
              And then strike home!
      </p>

      <p>
        Tread those reviving passions down,<br>
          Unworthy manhood!—unto thee<br>
        Indifferent should the smile or frown<br>
              Of beauty be.
      </p>

      <p>
        If thou regret’st thy youth, why live?<br>
          The land of honourable death<br>
        Is here:—up to the field, and give<br>
              Away thy breath!
      </p>

      <p>
        Seek out—less often sought than found—<br>
          A soldier’s grave, for thee the best;<br>
        Then look around, and choose thy ground,<br>
              And take thy rest.
      </p>
