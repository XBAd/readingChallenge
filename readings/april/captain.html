      <h2>O Captain! My Captain!</h2>

      <p>
        O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, <br>
        The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, <br>
        The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, <br>
        While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; <br>
              But O heart! heart! heart! <br>
                O the bleeding drops of red, <br>
                  Where on the deck my Captain lies, <br>
                    Fallen cold and dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
        Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br>
        For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>
        For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
              Here Captain! dear father!<br>
                This arm beneath your head!<br>
                  It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
                    You’ve fallen cold and dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br>
        My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br>
        The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>
        From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br>
              Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>
                But I with mournful tread,<br>
                  Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                    Fallen cold and dead.
      </p>

      <h2>When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d</h2>

      <h3>1</h3>

      <p>
        WHEN lilacs last in the dooryard bloom’d,<br>
        And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night,<br>
        I mourn’d, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.<br>
        Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,<br>
        Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,<br>
        And thought of him I love.
      </p>

      <h3>2</h3>

      <p>
        O powerful western fallen star!<br>
        O shades of night—O moody, tearful night!<br>
        O great star disappear’d—O the black murk that hides the star!<br>
        O cruel hands that hold me powerless—O helpless soul of me!<br>
        O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.
      </p>

      <h3>3</h3>

      <p>
        In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash’d palings,<br>
        Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,<br>
        With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love,<br>
        With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush in the dooryard,<br>
        With delicate-color’d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,<br>
        A sprig with its flower I break.
      </p>

      <h3>4</h3>

      <p>
        In the swamp in secluded recesses,<br>
        A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.
      </p>

      <p>
        Solitary the thrush,<br>
        The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,<br>
        Sings by himself a song.
      </p>

      <p>
        Song of the bleeding throat,<br>
        Death’s outlet song of life (for well dear brother I know,<br>
        If thou wast not granted to sing thou would’st surely die).
      </p>

      <h3>5</h3>

      <p>
        Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,<br>
        Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep’d from the ground, spotting the gray débris,<br>
        Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass,<br>
        Passing the yellow-spear’d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen,<br>
        Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,<br>
        Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,<br>
        Night and day journeys a coffin.
      </p>

      <h3>6</h3>

      <p>
        Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,<br>
        Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>
        With the pomp of the inloop’d flags with the cities draped in black,<br>
        With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil’d women standing,<br>
        With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,<br>
        With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads,<br>
        With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>
        With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn,<br>
        With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour’d around the coffin,<br>
        The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—where amid these you journey,<br>
        With the tolling tolling bells’ perpetual clang,<br>
        Here, coffin that slowly passes,<br>
        I give you my sprig of lilac.
      </p>

      <h3>7</h3>

      <p>
        (Nor for you, for one alone,<br>
        Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,<br>
        For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you<br>
            O sane and sacred death.
      </p>

      <p>
        All over bouquets of roses,<br>
        O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,<br>
        But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,<br>
        Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,<br>
        With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,<br>
        For you and the coffins all of you O death.)
      </p>

      <h3>8</h3>

      <p>
        O western orb sailing the heaven,<br>
        Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk’d,<br>
        As I walk’d in silence the transparent shadowy night,<br>
        As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,<br>
        As you droop’d from the sky low down as if to my side (while the other stars all look’d on),<br>
        As we wander’d together the solemn night (for something I know not what kept me from sleep),<br>
        As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe,<br>
        As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,<br>
        As I watch’d where you pass’d and was lost in the netherward black of the night,<br>
        As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,<br>
        Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.
      </p>

      <h3>9</h3>

      <p>
        Sing on there in the swamp,<br>
        O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,<br>
        I hear, I come presently, I understand you,<br>
        But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain’d me,<br>
        The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.
      </p>

      <h3>10</h3>

      <p>
        O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?<br>
        And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?<br>
        And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?
      </p>

      <p>
        Sea-winds blown from east and west,<br>
        Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there on the prairies meeting,<br>
        These and with these and the breath of my chant,<br>
        I’ll perfume the grave of him I love.
      </p>

      <h3>11</h3>

      <p>
        O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?<br>
        And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,<br>
        To adorn the burial-house of him I love?
      </p>

      <p>
        Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,<br>
        With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,<br>
        With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air,<br>
        With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,<br>
        In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there,<br>
        With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows,<br>
        And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,<br>
        And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.
      </p>

      <h3>12</h3>

      <p>
        Lo, body and soul—this land,<br>
        My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships,<br>
        The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio’s shores and flashing Missouri,<br>
        And ever the far-spreading prairies cover’d with grass and corn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,<br>
        The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,<br>
        The gentle soft-born measureless light,<br>
        The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill’d noon,<br>
        The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,<br>
        Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.
      </p>

      <h3>13</h3>

      <p>
        Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,<br>
        Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,<br>
        Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.<br>
        Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,<br>
        Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.<br>
        O liquid and free and tender!<br>
        O wild and loose to my soul—O wondrous singer!<br>
        You only I hear—yet the star holds me (but will soon depart),<br>
        Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.
      </p>

      <h3>14</h3>

      <p>
        Now while I sat in the day and look’d forth,<br>
        In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops,<br>
        In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,<br>
        In the heavenly aerial beauty (after the perturb’d winds and the storms),<br>
        Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women,<br>
        The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail’d,<br>
        And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor,<br>
        And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages,<br>
        And the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent—lo, then and there,<br>
        Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,<br>
        Appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail,<br>
        And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,<br>
        And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,<br>
        And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,<br>
        I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,<br>
        Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,<br>
        To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.<br>
        And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me,<br>
        The gray-brown bird I know receiv’d us comrades three,<br>
        And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.
      </p>

      <p>
        From deep secluded recesses,<br>
        From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,<br>
        Came the carol of the bird.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the charm of the carol rapt me,<br>
        As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,<br>
        And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.
      </p>

      <p>
        Come lovely and soothing death,<br>
        Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>
        In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>
        Sooner or later delicate death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prais’d be the fathomless universe,<br>
        For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>
        And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise!<br>
        For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>
        Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>
        Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>
        I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Approach strong deliveress,<br>
        When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,<br>
        Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,<br>
        Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.
      </p>

      <p>
        From me to thee glad serenades,<br>
        Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,<br>
        And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting,<br>
        And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.
      </p>

      <p>
        The night in silence under many a star,<br>
        The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,<br>
        And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil’d death,<br>
        And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,<br>
        Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide,<br>
        Over the dense-pack’d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,<br>
        I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.
      </p>

      <h3>15</h3>

      <p>
        To the tally of my soul,<br>
        Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,<br>
        With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loud in the pines and cedars dim,<br>
        Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp perfume,<br>
        And I with my comrades there in the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,<br>
        As to long panoramas of visions.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I saw askant the armies,<br>
        I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,<br>
        Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc’d with missiles I saw them,<br>
        And carried hither and you through the smoke, and torn and bloody,<br>
        And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence),<br>
        And the staffs all splinter’d and broken.
      </p>

      <p>
        I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,<br>
        And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,<br>
        I saw the débris and débris of all the slain soldiers of the war,<br>
        But I saw they were not as was thought,<br>
        They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer’d not,<br>
        The living remain’d and suffer’d, the mother suffer’d,<br>
        And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer’d,<br>
        And the armies that remain’d suffer’d.
      </p>

      <h3>16</h3>

      <p>
        Passing the visions, passing the night,<br>
        Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands,<br>
        Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,<br>
        Victorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,<br>
        As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,<br>
        Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy,<br>
        Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,<br>
        As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,<br>
        Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,<br>
        I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.
      </p>

      <p>
        I cease from my song for thee,<br>
        From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,<br>
        O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,<br>
        The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,<br>
        And the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul,<br>
        With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,<br>
        With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,<br>
        Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well,<br>
        For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake,<br>
        Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,<br>
        There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.
