      <h2>Act IV</h2>

      <h2>Scene VI</h2>

      <p>
        [...]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  From the dread summit of this chalky bourn. <br>
      Look up a-height; the shrill-gorg’d lark so far<br>
      Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Alack, I have no eyes.<br>
      Is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit,<br>
      To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort,<br>
      When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage,<br>
      And frustrate his proud will.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        Give me your arm.<br>
      Up: so. How is ’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Too well, too well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        This is above all strangeness.<br>
      Upon the crown o’ the cliff, what thing was that<br>
      Which parted from you?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        A poor unfortunate beggar.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br>
      Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br>
      Horns whelk’d and waved like the enridged sea.<br>
      It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,<br>
      Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br>
      Of men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  I do remember now. Henceforth I’ll bear<br>
      Affliction till it do cry out itself,<br>
      “Enough, enough,” and die. That thing you speak of,<br>
      I took it for a man; often ’twould say,<br>
      “The fiend, the fiend!” He led me to that place.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Bear free and patient thoughts.
      </p>

      <em>Enter LEAR [fantastically dressed with wild flowers]</em>

      <p>
        But who comes here?<br>
        The safer sense will ne’er accommodate<br>
        His master thus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  No, they cannot touch me for coining;<br>
      I am the King himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  O thou side-piercing sight!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper; draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! I’ the clout, i’ the clout! Hewgh! Give the word.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Sweet marjoram.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  I know that voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatter’d me like a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say “ay” and “no” to everything that I said! “Ay” and “no” too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything; ’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  The trick of that voice I do well remember.<br>
      Is ’t not the King?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>          Ay, every inch a king!<br>
      When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br>
      I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?<br>
      Adultery?<br>
      Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery! No:<br>
      The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly<br>
      Does lecher in my sight.<br>
      Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son<br>
      Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br>
      Got ’tween the lawful sheets.<br>
      To ’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br>
      Behold yond simp’ring dame,<br>
      Whose face between her forks presages snow,<br>
      That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br>
      To hear of pleasure’s name,—<br>
      The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to ’t<br>
      With a more riotous appetite.<br>
      Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br>
      Though women all above;<br>
      But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br>
      Beneath is all the fiends’;<br>
      There’s hell, there’s darkness, there’s the sulphurous pit,<br>
      Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!<br>
      Give me an ounce of civet; good apothecary, sweeten my imagination.<br>
      There’s money for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  O, let me kiss that hand!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  O ruin’d piece of nature! This great world<br>
      Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  [Aside.]  I would not take this from report. It is; and my heart breaks at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Read.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  What, with the case of eyes?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how this world goes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  I see it feelingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears; see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places, and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou has seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Ay, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obey’d in office.<br>
      Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br>
      Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back;<br>
      Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind<br>
      For which thou whip’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.<br>
      Through tatter’d clothes great vices do appear;<br>
      Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sins with gold,<br>
      And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;<br>
      Arm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.<br>
      None does offend, none, I say, none; I’ll able ’em.<br>
      Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br>
      To seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,<br>
      And, like a scurvy politician, seem<br>
      To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now.<br>
      Pull off my boots; harder, harder: so.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  O, matter and impertinency mix’d!<br>
      Reason in madness!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.<br>
      I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.<br>
      Thou must be patient; we came crying hither.<br>
      Thou know’st, the first time that we smell the air,<br>
      We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee; mark.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Alack, alack the day!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  When we are born, we cry that we are come<br>
      To this great stage of fools.—This a good block.<br>
      It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe<br>
      A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put ’t in proof;<br>
      And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,<br>
      Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
      </p>

      <em>Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants]</em>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  O, here he is! Lay hand upon him. Sir,<br>
      Your most dear daughter—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even<br>
      The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;<br>
      You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;<br>
      I am cut to the brains.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>        You shall have anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  No seconds? All myself?<br>
      Why, this would make a man a man of salt,<br>
      To use his eyes for garden water-pots,<br>
      [Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>        Good sir,—]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial. Come, come; I am a king,<br>
      My masters, know you that?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  You are a royal one, and we obey you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Then there’s life in ’t. Come, an you get it, you shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.  Exit [running; Attendants follow].
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,<br>
      Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter<br>
      Who redeems Nature from the general curse<br>
      Which twain have brought her to.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Hail, gentle sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>        Sir, speed you: what’s your will?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Most sure and vulgar; every one hears that,<br>
      Which can distinguish sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        But, by your favour,<br>
      How near’s the other army?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Near and on speedy foot; the main descry<br>
      Stands on the hourly thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  I thank you, sir; that’s all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Though that the Queen on special cause is here,<br>
      Her army is mov’d on.  Exit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        I thank you, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;<br>
      Let not my worser spirit tempt me again<br>
      To die before you please!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>        Well pray you, father.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  Now, good sir, what are you?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows;<br>
      Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,<br>
      Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,<br>
      I’ll lead you to some biding.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Hearty thanks;<br>
      The bounty and the benison of Heaven<br>
      To boot, and boot!
      </p>

      <em>Enter Steward [OSWALD]</em>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        A proclaim’d prize! Most happy!<br>
      That eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh<br>
      To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,<br>
      Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out<br>
      That must destroy thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        Now let thy friendly hand<br>
      Put strength enough to ’t.  [EDGAR interposes.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>        Wherefore, bold peasant,<br>
      Dar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence;<br>
      Lest that the infection of his fortune take<br>
      Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  ’Chill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Let go, slave, or thou diest!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk pass. An ’chud ha’ bin zwagger’d out of my life, ’t would not ha’bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’ old man; keep out, ’che vor ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder. ’Chill be plain with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Out, dunghill!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  ’Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come, no matter vor your foins.  [They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Osw.</em>  Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.<br>
      If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;<br>
      And give the letters which thou find’st about me<br>
      To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester; seek him out<br>
      Upon the English party. O, untimely death!<br>
      Death!  Dies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  I know thee well; a serviceable villain,<br>
      As duteous to the vices of thy mistress<br>
      As badness would desire.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>        What, is he dead?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Sit you down, father; rest you.<br>
      Let’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of<br>
      May be my friends. He’s dead; I am only sorry<br>
      He had no other death’s-man. Let us see.<br>
      Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.<br>
      To know our enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts;<br>
      Their papers, is more lawful.<br>
        (Reads the letter.) “Let our reciprocal vows be rememb’red. You have many opportunities to cut him off; if your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offer’d. There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror; then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour.<br>
      “Your—wife, so I would say—<br>
      “Affectionate servant,<br>
      “GONERIL.”<br>
      O indistinguish’d space of woman’s will!<br>
      A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life;<br>
      And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,<br>
      Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified<br>
      Of murderous lechers; and in the mature time<br>
      With this ungracious paper strike the sight<br>
      Of the death-practis’d duke. For him ’tis well<br>
      That of thy death and business I can tell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Glou.</em>  The King is mad; how stiff is my vile sense<br>
      That I stand up and have ingenious feeling<br>
      Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract;<br>
      So should my thoughts be sever’d from my griefs,  Drum afar off.<br>
      And woes by wrong imaginations lose<br>
      The knowledge of themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Edg.</em>  Give me your hand.<br>
      Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum.<br>
      Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.  Exeunt.
      </p>

      <h3>[A tent in the French camp]</h3>

      <em>Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor</em>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>  O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work<br>
      To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,<br>
      And every measure fail me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kent.</em>  To be acknowledg’d, madam, is o’er-paid.<br>
      All my reports go with the modest truth;<br>
      Nor more nor clipp’d, but so.

        <em>Cor.</em>        Be better suited;<br>
      These weeds are memories of those worser hours.<br>

        <em>Kent.</em>        Pardon, dear madam;<br>
      Yet to be known shortens my made intent.<br>
      My boon I make it, that you know me not<br>

      <em>Enter LEAR in a chair carried by Servants. [Gentleman in attendance]</em>

      <p>
        Is he array’d?

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Ay, madam; in the heaviness of sleep<br>
      We put fresh garments on him.

        <em>Cor.</em>  Had you not been their father, these white flakes<br>
      Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face<br>
      To be oppos’d against the warring winds?<br>

      In the most terrible and nimble stroke<br>
      Of quick, cross lightning? to watch—poor perdu!—<br>
      With this thin helm?] Mine enemy’s dog,<br>
      Though he had bit me, should have stood that night<br>
      Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,<br>
      To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn<br>
      In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!<br>
      ’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once<br>
      Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Doct.</em>  Madam, do you; ’tis fittest.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>  How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  You do me wrong to take me out o’ the grave.<br>
      Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound<br>
      Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears<br>
      Do scald like molten lead.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>        Sir, do you know me?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  You are a spirit, I know; when did you die?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>  Still, still, far wide!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Doct.</em>  He’s scarce awake; let him alone a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?<br>
      I am mightily abus’d. I should even die with pity,<br>
      To see another thus. I know not what to say.<br>
      I will not swear these are my hands. Let’s see;<br>
      I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur’d<br>
      Of my condition!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>        O, look upon me, sir,<br>
      And hold your hand in benediction o’er me.<br>
      [No, sir,] you must not kneel.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>        Pray, do not mock me.<br>
      I am a very foolish fond old man,<br>
      Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;<br>
      And, to deal plainly,<br>
      I fear I am not in my perfect mind.<br>
      Methinks I should know you, and know this man;<br>
      Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant<br>
      What place this is, and all the skill I have<br>
      Remembers not these garments; nor I know not<br>
      Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;<br>
      For, as I am a man, I think this lady<br>
      To be my child Cordelia.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>        And so I am, I am.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not.<br>
      If you have poison for me, I will drink it.<br>
      I know you do not love me; for your sisters<br>
      Have, as I do remember, done me wrong;<br>
      You have some cause, they have not.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>        No cause, no cause.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Am I in France?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kent.</em>        In your own kingdom, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>  Do not abuse me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Doct.</em>  Be comforted, good madam; the great rage,<br>
      You see, is kill’d in him: [and yet it is danger<br>
      To make him even o’er the time he has lost.]<br>
      Desire him to go in; trouble him no more<br>
      Till further settling.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cor.</em>  Will ’t please your Highness walk?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Lear.</em>        You must bear with me.<br>
      Pray you now, forget and forgive; I am old and foolish.  Exeunt [all but KENT and Gentleman].
      </p>

      <p>
        [<em>Gent.</em>  Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kent.</em>  Most certain, sir.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  Who is conductor of his people?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kent.</em>  As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  They say Edgar, his banish’d son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kent.</em>  Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about; the powers of the kingdom approach apace.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Gent.</em>  The arbitrement is like to be bloody.<br>
      Fare you well, sir.  [Exit.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kent.</em>  My point and period will be throughly wrought,<br>
      Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.]  Exit.
