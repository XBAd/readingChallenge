      <h2>Concord Hymn</h2>

      <h3>Sung at the Completion of the Battle Monument, July 4, 1837</h3>

      <p>
        BY the rude bridge that arched the flood, <br>
          Their flag to Aprilâ€™s breeze unfurled,<br>
        Here once the embattled farmers stood<br>
          And fired the shot heard round the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The foe long since in silence slept;<br>
          Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;<br>
        And Time the ruined bridge has swept<br>
          Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this green bank, by this soft stream,<br>
          We set to-day a votive stone;<br>
        That memory may their deed redeem,<br>
          When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spirit, that made those heroes dare<br>
          To die, and leave their children free,<br>
        Bid Time and Nature gently spare<br>
          The shaft we raise to them and thee.
