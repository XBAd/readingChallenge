      <h2>The Tiger</h2>

      <p>
        TIGER, tiger, burning bright <br>
        In the forests of the night,<br>
        What immortal hand or eye<br>
        Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
      </p>

      <p>
        In what distant deeps or skies<br>
        Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
        On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
        What the hand dare seize the fire?
      </p>

      <p>
        And what shoulder and what art<br>
        Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
        And, when thy heart began to beat,<br>
        What dread hand and what dread feet?
      </p>

      <p>
        What the hammer? What the chain?<br>
        In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
        What the anvil? What dread grasp<br>
        Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
      </p>

      <p>
        When the stars threw down their spears,<br>
        And water’d heaven with their tears,<br>
        Did He smile His work to see?<br>
        Did He who made the lamb make thee?
      </p>

      <p>
        Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br>
        In the forests of the night,<br>
        What immortal hand or eye<br>
        Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
      </p>

      <h2>Ah! Sun-Flower</h2>

      <p>
        AH, sun-flower! weary of time,<br>
        Who countest the steps of the Sun;<br>
        Seeking after that sweet golden clime,<br>
        Where the traveller’s journey is done;
      </p>

      <p>
        Where the Youth pined away with desire,<br>
        And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow,<br>
        Arise from their graves, and aspire<br>
        Where my sun-flower wishes to go.
      </p>

      <h2>To Spring</h2>

      <p>
        O THOU with dewy locks, who lookest down<br>
        Through the clear windows of the morning, turn<br>
        Thine angel eyes upon our western isle,<br>
        Which in full choir hails thy approach, O Spring!
      </p>

      <p>
        The hills tell one another, and the listening<br>
        Valleys hear; all our longing eyes are turn’d<br>
        Up to thy bright pavilions: issue forth<br>
        And let thy holy feet visit our clime!
      </p>

      <p>
        Come o’er the eastern hills, and let our winds<br>
        Kiss thy perfumèd garments; let us taste<br>
        Thy morn and evening breath; scatter thy pearls<br>
        Upon our lovesick land that mourns for thee.
      </p>

      <p>
        O deck her forth with thy fair fingers; pour<br>
        Thy soft kisses on her bosom; and put<br>
        Thy golden crown upon her languish’d head,<br>
        Whose modest tresses are bound up for thee.
      </p>

      <h2>Reeds of Innocence</h2>

      <p>
        PIPING down the valleys wild,<br>
          Piping songs of pleasant glee,<br>
        On a cloud I saw a child,<br>
          And he laughing said to me:
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Pipe a song about a Lamb!’<br>
          So I piped with merry cheer.<br>
        ‘Piper, pipe that song again;’<br>
          So I piped: he wept to hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;<br>
          Sing thy songs of happy cheer!’<br>
        So I sung the same again,<br>
          While he wept with joy to hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Piper, sit thee down and write<br>
          In a book that all may read.’<br>
        So he vanish’d from my sight;<br>
          And I pluck’d a hollow reed,
      </p>

      <p>
        And I made a rural pen,<br>
          And I stain’d the water clear,<br>
        And I wrote my happy songs<br>
          Every child may joy to hear.
      </p>

      <h2>Night</h2>

      <p>
        THE SUN descending in the west,<br>
          The evening star does shine;<br>
        The birds are silent in their nest,<br>
          And I must seek for mine.<br>
            The moon, like a flower<br>
            In heaven’s high bower,<br>
            With silent delight<br>
            Sits and smiles on the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Farewell, green fields and happy grove,<br>
          Where flocks have took delight:<br>
        Where lambs have nibbled, silent move<br>
          The feet of angels bright;<br>
            Unseen they pour blessing<br>
            And joy without ceasing<br>
            On each bud and blossom,<br>
            On each sleeping bosom.
      </p>

      <p>
        They look in every thoughtless nest<br>
          Where birds are cover’d warm;<br>
        They visit caves of every beast,<br>
          To keep them all from harm:<br>
            If they see any weeping<br>
            That should have been sleeping,<br>
            They pour sleep on their head,<br>
            And sit down by their bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        When wolves and tigers howl for prey,<br>
          They pitying stand and weep,<br>
        Seeking to drive their thirst away<br>
          And keep them from the sheep.<br>
            But, if they rush dreadful,<br>
            The angels, most heedful,<br>
            Receive each mild spirit,<br>
            New worlds to inherit.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there the lion’s ruddy eyes<br>
          Shall flow with tears of gold:<br>
        And pitying the tender cries,<br>
          And walking round the fold:<br>
            Saying, ‘Wrath by His meekness,<br>
            And, by His health, sickness,<br>
            Are driven away<br>
            From our immortal day.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘And now beside thee, bleating lamb,<br>
          I can lie down and sleep,<br>
        Or think on Him who bore thy name,<br>
          Graze after thee, and weep.<br>
            For, wash’d in life’s river,<br>
            My bright mane for ever<br>
            Shall shine like the gold<br>
            As I guard o’er the fold.’
      </p>

      <h2>Auguries of Innocence</h2>

      <p>
        TO see a world in a grain of sand,<br>
          And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>
        Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,<br>
          And eternity in an hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        A robin redbreast in a cage<br>
        Puts all heaven in a rage.<br>
        A dove-house fill’d with doves and pigeons<br>
        Shudders hell thro’ all its regions.<br>
        A dog starv’d at his master’s gate<br>
        Predicts the ruin of the state.<br>
        A horse misused upon the road<br>
        Calls to heaven for human blood.<br>
        Each outcry of the hunted hare<br>
        A fibre from the brain does tear.<br>
        A skylark wounded in the wing,<br>
        A cherubim does cease to sing.<br>
        The game-cock clipt and arm’d for fight<br>
        Does the rising sun affright.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every wolf’s and lion’s howl<br>
        Raises from hell a human soul.<br>
        The wild deer, wand’ring here and there,<br>
        Keeps the human soul from care.<br>
        The lamb misus’d breeds public strife,<br>
        And yet forgives the butcher’s knife.<br>
        The bat that flits at close of eve<br>
        Has left the brain that won’t believe.<br>
        The owl that calls upon the night<br>
        Speaks the unbeliever’s fright.<br>
        He who shall hurt the little wren<br>
        Shall never be belov’d by men.<br>
        He who the ox to wrath has mov’d<br>
        Shall never be by woman lov’d.<br>
        The wanton boy that kills the fly<br>
        Shall feel the spider’s enmity.<br>
        He who torments the chafer’s sprite<br>
        Weaves a bower in endless night.<br>
        The caterpillar on the leaf<br>
        Repeats to thee thy mother’s grief.<br>
        Kill not the moth nor butterfly,<br>
        For the last judgment draweth nigh.<br>
        He who shall train the horse to war<br>
        Shall never pass the polar bar.<br>
        The beggar’s dog and widow’s cat,<br>
        Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.<br>
        The gnat that sings his summer’s song<br>
        Poison gets from slander’s tongue.<br>
        The poison of the snake and newt<br>
        Is the sweat of envy’s foot.<br>
        The poison of the honey bee<br>
        Is the artist’s jealousy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prince’s robes and beggar’s rags<br>
        Are toadstools on the miser’s bags.<br>
        A truth that’s told with bad intent<br>
        Beats all the lies you can invent.<br>
        It is right it should be so;<br>
        Man was made for joy and woe;<br>
        And when this we rightly know,<br>
        Thro’ the world we safely go.<br>
        Joy and woe are woven fine,<br>
        A clothing for the soul divine.<br>
        Under every grief and pine<br>
        Runs a joy with silken twine.<br>
        The babe is more than swaddling bands;<br>
        Throughout all these human lands<br>
        Tools were made, and born were hands,<br>
        Every farmer understands.<br>
        Every tear from every eye<br>
        Becomes a babe in eternity;<br>
        This is caught by females bright,<br>
        And return’d to its own delight.<br>
        The bleat, the bark, bellow, and roar,<br>
        Are waves that beat on heaven’s shore.<br>
        The babe that weeps the rod beneath<br>
        Writes revenge in realms of death.<br>
        The beggar’s rags, fluttering in air,<br>
        Does to rags the heavens tear.<br>
        The soldier, arm’d with sword and gun,<br>
        Palsied strikes the summer’s sun.<br>
        The poor man’s farthing is worth more<br>
        Than all the gold on Afric’s shore.<br>
        One mite wrung from the lab’rer’s hands<br>
        Shall buy and sell the miser’s lands;<br>
        Or, if protected from on high,<br>
        Does that whole nation sell and buy.<br>
        He who mocks the infant’s faith<br>
        Shall be mock’d in age and death.<br>
        He who shall teach the child to doubt<br>
        The rotting grave shall ne’er get out.<br>
        He who respects the infant’s faith<br>
        Triumphs over hell and death.<br>
        The child’s toys and the old man’s reasons<br>
        Are the fruits of the two seasons.<br>
        The questioner, who sits so sly,<br>
        Shall never know how to reply.<br>
        He who replies to words of doubt<br>
        Doth put the light of knowledge out.<br>
        The strongest poison ever known<br>
        Came from Caesar’s laurel crown.<br>
        Nought can deform the human race<br>
        Like to the armour’s iron brace.<br>
        When gold and gems adorn the plow,<br>
        To peaceful arts shall envy bow.<br>
        A riddle, or the cricket’s cry,<br>
        Is to doubt a fit reply.<br>
        The emmet’s inch and eagle’s mile<br>
        Make lame philosophy to smile.<br>
        He who doubts from what he sees<br>
        Will ne’er believe, do what you please.<br>
        If the sun and moon should doubt,<br>
        They’d immediately go out.<br>
        To be in a passion you good may do,<br>
        But no good if a passion is in you.<br>
        The whore and gambler, by the state<br>
        Licensed, build that nation’s fate.<br>
        The harlot’s cry from street to street<br>
        Shall weave old England’s winding-sheet.<br>
        The winner’s shout, the loser’s curse,<br>
        Dance before dead England’s hearse.<br>
        Every night and every morn<br>
        Some to misery are born,<br>
        Every morn and every night<br>
        Some are born to sweet delight.<br>
        Some are born to sweet delight,<br>
        Some are born to endless night.<br>
        We are led to believe a lie<br>
        When we see not thro’ the eye,<br>
        Which was born in a night to perish in a night,<br>
        When the soul slept in beams of light.<br>
        God appears, and God is light,<br>
        To those poor souls who dwell in night;<br>
        But does a human form display<br>
        To those who dwell in realms of day.
      </p>

      <h2>Nurse’s Song</h2>

      <p>
        WHEN the voices of children are heard on the green,<br>
          And laughing is heard on the hill,<br>
        My heart is at rest within my breast,<br>
          And everything else is still.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,<br>
          And the dews of night arise;<br>
        Come, come, leave off play, and let us away<br>
          Till the morning appears in the skies.’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,<br>
          And we cannot go to sleep;<br>
        Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,<br>
          And the hills are all cover’d with sheep.’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,<br>
          And then go home to bed.’<br>
        The little ones leapèd and shoutèd and laugh’d<br>
          And all the hills echoèd.
      </p>

      <h2>Holy Thursday</h2>

      <p>
        ’TWAS on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,<br>
        The children walking two and two, in red and blue and green,<br>
        Grey headed beadles walk’d before, with wands as white as snow,<br>
        Till unto the high dome of Paul’s they like Thames’ waters flow.
      </p>

      <p>
        O what a multitude they seem’d, these flowers of London town!<br>
        Seated in companies, they sit with radiance all their own.<br>
        The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,<br>
        Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,<br>
        Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among.<br>
        Beneath them sit the agèd men, wise guardians of the poor;<br>
        Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.
      </p>

      <h2>The Divine Image</h2>

      <p>
        TO Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love<br>
        All pray in their distress;<br>
        And to these virtues of delight<br>
        Return their thankfulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love<br>
        Is God, our father dear,<br>
        And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love<br>
        Is Man, his child and care.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Mercy has a human heart,<br>
        Pity a human face,<br>
        And Love, the human form divine,<br>
        And Peace, the human dress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then every man, of every clime,<br>
        That prays in his distress,<br>
        Prays to the human form divine,<br>
        Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all must love the human form,<br>
        In heathen, Turk, or Jew;<br>
        Where Mercy, Love and Pity dwell,<br>
        There God is dwelling too.
      </p>

      <h2>Song</h2>

      <p>
        FRESH from the dewy hill, the merry year<br>
        Smiles on my head and mounts his flaming car;<br>
        Round my young brows the laurel wreathes a shade,<br>
        And rising glories beam around my head.
      </p>

      <p>
        My feet are wing’d, while o’er the dewy lawn,<br>
        I meet my maiden risen like the morn:<br>
        Oh bless those holy feet, like angel’s feet;<br>
        Oh bless those limbs, beaming with heav’nly light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like as an angel glitt’ring in the sky<br>
        In times of innocence and holy joy;<br>
        The joyful shepherd stops his grateful song<br>
        To hear the music of an angel’s tongue.
      </p>

      <p>
        So when she speaks, the voice of heaven I hear;<br>
        So when we walk, nothing impure comes near;<br>
        Each field seems Eden, and each calm retreat,<br>
        Each village seems the haunt of holy feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that sweet village where my black-ey’d maid<br>
        Closes her eyes in sleep beneath night’s shade,<br>
        Whene’er I enter, more than mortal fire<br>
        Burns in my soul, and does my song inspire.
