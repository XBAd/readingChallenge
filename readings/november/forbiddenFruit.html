        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost" target="_blank">Paradise Lost</a>
           is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608–1674).
           The first version, published in 1667, consists of ten books with over
           ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged
           into twelve books (in the manner of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions
           throughout and a note on the versification. It is considered by critics
           to be Milton's major work, and it helped solidify his reputation as
           one of the greatest English poets of his time. The poem concerns the
           biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by
           the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
           Milton's purpose, stated in Book I, is to "justify the ways of God to men."

      <h2>The Ninth Book</h2>

      <p>
        Queen of this Universe! do not believe <br>
        Those rigid threats of death. Ye shall not die.
      </p>

      <p>
        How should ye? By the Fruit? it gives you life<br>
        To knowledge. By the Threatener? look on me,<br>
        Me who have touched and tasted, yet both live,<br>
        And life more perfect have attained than Fate<br>
        Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.<br>
        Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast<br>
        Is open? or will God incense his ire<br>
        For such a petty trespass, and not praise<br>
        Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain<br>
        Of death denounced, whatever thing Death be,<br>
        Deterred not from achieving what might lead<br>
        To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil?<br>
        Of good, how just! of evil—if what is evil<br>
        Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?<br>
        God, therefore, cannot hurt ye and be just;<br>
        Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:<br>
        Your fear itself of death removes the fear.<br>
        Why, then, was this forbid? Why but to awe,<br>
        Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,<br>
        His worshipers? He knows that in the day<br>
        Ye eat thereof your eyes, that seem so clear,<br>
        Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then<br>
        Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,<br>
        Knowing both good and evil, as they know.<br>
        That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,<br>
        Internal Man, is but proportion meet—<br>
        I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.<br>
        So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off<br>
        Human, to put on Gods—death to be wished,<br>
        Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring!<br>
        And what are Gods, that Man may not become<br>
        As they, participating godlike food?<br>
        The Gods are first, and that advantage use<br>
        On our belief, that all from them proceeds.<br>
        I question it; for this fair Earth I see,<br>
        Warmed by the Sun, producing every kind;<br>
        Them nothing. If they all things, who enclosed<br>
        Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,<br>
        That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains<br>
        Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies<br>
        The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?<br>
        What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree<br>
        Impart against his will, if all be his?<br>
        Or is it envy? and can envy dwell<br>
        In Heavenly breasts? These, these and many more<br>
        Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.<br>
        Goddess humane, reach, then, and freely taste!”
      </p>

      <p>
        He ended; and his words, replete with guile,<br>
      Into her heart too easy entrance won.<br>
      Fixed on the Fruit she gazed, which to behold<br>
      Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound<br>
      Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned<br>
      With reason, to her seeming, and with truth.<br>
      Meanwhile the hour of noon drew on, and waked<br>
      An eager appetite, raised by the smell<br>
      So savoury of that Fruit, which with desire,<br>
      Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,<br>
      Solicited her longing eye; yet first,<br>
      Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of Fruits,<br>
      Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admired,<br>
      Whose taste, too long forborne, at first assay<br>
      Gave elocution to the mute, and taught<br>
      The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise.<br>
      Thy praise he also who forbids thy use<br>
      Conceals not from us, naming thee the Tree<br>
      Of Knowledge, knowledge both of Good and Evil;<br>
      Forbids us then to taste. But his forbidding<br>
      Commends thee more, while it infers the good<br>
      By thee communicated, and our want;<br>
      For good unknown sure is not bad, or, had<br>
      And yet unknown, is as not had at all.<br>
      In plain, then, what forbids he but to know?<br>
      Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise!<br>
      Such prohibitions bind not. But, if Death<br>
      Bind us with after-bands, what profits then<br>
      Our inward freedom? In the day we eat<br>
      Of this fair Fruit, our doom is we shall die!<br>
      How dies the Serpent? He hath eaten, and lives,<br>
      And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,<br>
      Irrational till then. For us alone<br>
      Was death invented? or to us denied<br>
      This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?<br>
      For beasts it seems; yet that one beast which first<br>
      Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy<br>
      The good befallen him, author unsuspect,<br>
      Friendly to Man, far from deceit or guile.<br>
      What fear I, then? rather, what know to fear<br>
      Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,<br>
      Of God or Death, of law or penalty?<br>
      Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,<br>
      Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,<br>
      Of virtue to make wise. What hinders, then,<br>
      To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?”
      </p>

      <p>
        So saying, her rash hand in evil hour<br>
      Forth-reaching to the Fruit, she plucked, she eat.<br>
      Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,<br>
      Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe<br>
      That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk<br>
      The guilty Serpent, and well might, for Eve,<br>
      Intent now only her taste, naught else<br>
      Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,<br>
      In fruit she never tasted, whether true,<br>
      Or fancied so through expectation high<br>
      Of knowledge; nor was Godhead from her thought.<br>
      Greedily she ingorged without restraint,<br>
      And knew not eating death. Satiate at length,<br>
      And hightened as with wine, <span class="tooltip">jocond<span class="tooltiptext">cheerful and lighthearted.</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">boon<span class="tooltiptext">convivial</span></span>,<br>
      Thus to herself she pleasingly began:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees<br>
      In Paradise! of operation blest<br>
      To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed,<br>
      And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end<br>
      Created! but henceforth my early care,<br>
      Not without song, each morning, and due praise,<br>
      Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease<br>
      Of thy full branches, offered free to all;<br>
      Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature<br>
      In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know,<br>
      Though others envy what they cannot give—<br>
      For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here<br>
      Thus grown! Experience, next to thee I owe,<br>
      Best guide: not following thee, I had remained<br>
      In ignorance; thou open’st Wisdom’s way,<br>
      And giv’st access, though secret she retire.<br>
      And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high—<br>
      High, and remote to see from thence distinct<br>
      Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps<br>
      May have diverted from continual watch<br>
      Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies<br>
      About him. But to Adam in what sort<br>
      Shall I appear? Shall I to him make known<br>
      As yet my change, and give him to partake<br>
      Full happiness with me, or rather not,<br>
      But keep the odds of knowledge in my power<br>
      Without copartner? so to add what wants<br>
      In female sex, the more to draw his love,<br>
      And render me more equal, and perhaps—<br>
      A thing not undesirable—sometime<br>
      Superior; for, inferior, who is free?<br>
      This may be well; but what if God have seen,<br>
      And death ensue? Then I shall be no more;<br>
      And Adam, wedded to another Eve,<br>
      Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct!<br>
      A death to think! Confirmed, then, I resolve<br>
      Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe.<br>
      So dear I love him that with him all deaths<br>
      I could endure, without him live no life.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So saying, from the Tree her step she turned,<br>
      But first low reverence done, as to the Power<br>
      That dwelt within, whose presence had infused<br>
      Into the plant sciential sap, derived<br>
      From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while,<br>
      Waiting desirous her return, had wove<br>
      Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn<br>
      Her tresses, and her rural labours crown,<br>
      As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.<br>
      Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new<br>
      Solace in her return, so long delayed;<br>
      Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,<br>
      Misgave him. He the faltering measure felt,<br>
      And forth to meet her went, the way she took<br>
      That morn when first they parted. By the Tree<br>
      Of Knowledge he must pass; there he her met,<br>
      Scarce from the Tree returning; in her hand<br>
      A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,<br>
      New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.<br>
      To him she hasted; in her face excuse<br>
      Came prologue, and apology to prompt,<br>
      Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?<br>
      Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived<br>
      Thy presence—agony of love till now<br>
      Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more<br>
      Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,<br>
      The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange<br>
      Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear.<br>
      This Tree is not, as we are told, a Tree<br>
      Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown<br>
      Opening the way, but of divine effect<br>
      To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;<br>
      And hath been tasted such. The Serpent wise,<br>
      Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,<br>
      Hath eaten of the Fruit, and is become<br>
      Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth<br>
      Endued with human voice and human sense,<br>
      Reasoning to admiration, and with me<br>
      Persuasively hath so prevailed that I<br>
      Have also tasted, and have also found<br>
      The effects to correspond—opener mine eyes,<br>
      Dim <span class="tooltip">erst<span class="tooltiptext">long ago; formerly.</span></span>, dilated spirits, ampler heart,<br>
      And growing up to Godhead; which for thee<br>
      Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.<br>
      For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;<br>
      Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.<br>
      Thou, therefore, also taste, that equal lot<br>
      May join us, equal joy, as equal love;<br>
      Lest, thou not tasting, different degree<br>
      Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce<br>
      Deity for thee, when fate will not permit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;<br>
      But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.<br>
      On the other side, Adam, soon as he heard<br>
      The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,<br>
      Astonied stood and blank, while horror chill<br>
      Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed.<br>
      From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve<br>
      Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed.<br>
      Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length<br>
      First to himself he inward silence broke:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O fairest of Creation, last and best<br>
      Of all God’s works, creature in whom excelled<br>
      Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,<br>
      Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!<br>
      How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,<br>
      Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!<br>
      Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress<br>
      The strict forbiddance, how to violate<br>
      The sacred Fruit forbidden? Some cursed fraud<br>
      Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,<br>
      And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee<br>
      Certain my resolution is to die.<br>
      How can I live without thee? how forgo<br>
      Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,<br>
      To live again in these wild woods forlorn?<br>
      Should God create another Eve, and I<br>
      Another rib afford, yet loss of thee<br>
      Would never from my heart. No, no! I feel<br>
      The link of nature draw me: flesh of flesh,<br>
      Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state<br>
      Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So having said, as one from sad dismay<br>
      Recomforted, and, after thoughts disturbed,<br>
      Submitting to what seemed remediless,<br>
      Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventrous Eve,<br>
      And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared<br>
      Had it been only coveting to eye<br>
      That sacred Food, sacred to abstinence;<br>
      Much more to taste it, under ban to touch.<br>
      But past who can recall, or done undo?<br>
      Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate! Yet so<br>
      Perhaps thou shalt not die; perhaps the fact<br>
      Is not so hainous now-foretasted Fruit,<br>
      Profaned first by the Serpent, by him first<br>
      Made common and unhallowed ere our taste,<br>
      Nor yet on him found deadly. He yet lives—<br>
      Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,<br>
      Higher degree of life: inducement strong<br>
      To us, as likely, tasting, to attain<br>
      Proportional ascent; which cannot be<br>
      But to be Gods, or Angels, Demi-gods.<br>
      Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,<br>
      Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy<br>
      Us, his prime creatures, dignified so high,<br>
      Set over all his works; which, in our fall,<br>
      For us created, needs with us must fail,<br>
      Dependent made. So God shall uncreate,<br>
      Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose—<br>
      Not well conceived of God; who, though his power<br>
      Creation could repeat, yet would be loth<br>
      Us to abolish, lest the Adversary<br>
      Triumph and say: ‘Fickle their state whom God<br>
      Most favours; who can please him long? Me first<br>
      He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?’—<br>
      Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe.<br>
      However, I with thee have fixed my lot,<br>
      Certain to undergo like doom. If death<br>
      Consort with thee, death is to me as life;<br>
      So forcible within my heart I feel<br>
      The bond of Nature draw me to my own—<br>
      My own is thee; for what thou art is mine.<br>
      Our state cannot be severed; we are one,<br>
      One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied:—<br>
      “O glorious trial of exceeding love,<br>
      Illustrious evidence, example high!<br>
      Ingaging me to emulate; but, short<br>
      Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,<br>
      Adam? from whose dear side I boast me sprung,<br>
      And gladly of our union hear thee speak,<br>
      One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof<br>
      This day affords, declaring thee resolved,<br>
      Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,<br>
      Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,<br>
      To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,<br>
      If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit;<br>
      Whose virtue (for of good still good proceeds,<br>
      Direct, or by occasion) hath presented<br>
      This happy trial of thy love, which else<br>
      So eminently never had been known.<br>
      Were it I thought death menaced would ensue<br>
      This my attempt, I would sustain alone<br>
      The worst, and not persuade thee—rather die<br>
      Deserted than oblige thee with a fact<br>
      Pernicious to thy peace, chiefly assured<br>
      Remarkably so late of thy so true,<br>
      So faithful love unequalled. But I feel<br>
      Far otherwise the event—not death, but life<br>
      Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,<br>
      Taste so divine that what of sweet before<br>
      Hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh.<br>
      On my experience, Adam, freely taste,<br>
      And fear of death deliver to the winds.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So saying, she embraced him, and for joy<br>
      Tenderly wept, much won that he his love<br>
      Had so ennobled as of choice to incur<br>
      Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.<br>
      In recompense (for such compliance bad<br>
      Such recompense best merits), from the bough<br>
      She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit<br>
      With liberal hand. He scrupled not to eat,<br>
      Against his better knowledge, not deceived,<br>
      But fondly overcome with female charm.<br>
      Earth trembled from her entrails, as again<br>
      In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan;<br>
      Sky <span class="tooltip">loured<span class="tooltiptext">(of the sky, weather, or landscape) look dark and threatening.</span></span>, and, muttering thunder, some sad drops<br>
      Wept at completing of the mortal Sin<br>
      Original; while Adam took no thought,<br>
      Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate<br>
      Her former trespass feared, the more to soothe<br>
      Him with her loved society; that now,<br>
      As with new wine intoxicated both,<br>
      They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel<br>
      Divinity within them breeding wings<br>
      Wherewith to scorn the Earth. But that false Fruit<br>
      Far other operation first displayed,<br>
      Carnal desire inflaming. He on Eve<br>
      Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him<br>
      As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn,<br>
      Till Adam thus ’gan Eve to dalliance move:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste<br>
      And elegant—of sapience no small part;<br>
      Since to each meaning savour we apply,<br>
      And palate call judicious. I the praise<br>
      Yield thee; so well this day thou hast purveyed.<br>
      Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained<br>
      From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now<br>
      True relish, tasting. If such pleasure be<br>
      In things to us forbidden, it might be wished<br>
      For this one Tree had been forbidden ten.<br>
      But come; so well refreshed, now let us play,<br>
      As meet is, after such delicious fare;<br>
      For never did thy beauty, since the day<br>
      I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned<br>
      With all perfections, so enflame my sense<br>
      With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now<br>
      Than ever-bounty of this virtuous Tree!”
      </p>

      <p>
        So said he, and forbore not glance or toy<br>
      Of amorous intent, well understood<br>
      Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.<br>
      Her hand he seized, and to a shady bank,<br>
      Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered,<br>
      He led her, nothing loth; flowers were the couch,<br>
      Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,<br>
      And hyacinth—Earth’s freshest, softest lap.<br>
      There they their fill of love and love’s <span class="tooltip">disport<span class="tooltiptext">diversion from work or serious matters; recreation or amusement.</span></span><br>
      Took largely, of their mutual gilt the seal,<br>
      The solace of their sin, till dewy sleep<br>
      Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,<br>
      That with exhilarating vapour bland<br>
      About their spirits had played, and inmost powers<br>
      Made err, was now exhaled, and grosser sleep,<br>
      Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams<br>
      Incumbered, now had left them, up they rose<br>
      As from unrest, and, each the other viewing,<br>
      Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds<br>
      How darkened. Innocence, that as a veil<br>
      Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;<br>
      Just confidence, and native righteousness,<br>
      And honour, from about them, naked left<br>
      To guilty Shame: he covered, but his robe<br>
      Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong,<br>
      Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap<br>
      Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked<br>
      Shorn of his strength; they destitute and bare<br>
      Of all their virtue. Silent, and in face<br>
      Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute;<br>
      Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,<br>
      At length gave utterance to these words constrained:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear<br>
      To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught<br>
      To counterfeit Man’s voice—true in our fall,<br>
      False in our promised rising; since our eyes<br>
      Opened we find indeed, and find we know<br>
      Both good and evil, good lost and evil got:<br>
      Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,<br>
      Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,<br>
      Of innocence, of faith, of purity,<br>
      Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,<br>
      And in our faces evident the signs<br>
      Of foul <span class="tooltip">concupiscence<span class="tooltiptext">strong sexual desire; lust.</span></span>; whence evil store,<br>
      Even shame, the last of evils; of the first<br>
      Be sure then. How shall I behold the face<br>
      Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy<br>
      And rapture so oft beheld? Those Heavenly Shapes<br>
      Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze<br>
      Insufferably bright. Oh, might I here<br>
      In solitude live savage, in some glade<br>
      Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable<br>
      To star or sunlight, spread their umbrage broad,<br>
      And brown as evening. Cover me, ye pines!<br>
      Ye cedars, with innumerable boughs<br>
      Hide me, where I may never see them more!<br>
      But let us now, as in bad plight, devise<br>
      What best may, for the present, serve to hide<br>
      The parts of each other that seem most<br>
      To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen—<br>
      Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves, together sewed,<br>
      And girded on our loins, may cover round<br>
      Those middle parts, that this new comer, Shame,<br>
      There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So counselled he, and both together went<br>
      Into the thickest wood. There soon they choose<br>
      The fig tree—not that kind for fruit renowned,<br>
      But such, as at this day, to Indians known,<br>
      In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms<br>
      Braunching so broad and long that in the ground<br>
      The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow<br>
      About the mother tree, a pillared shade<br>
      High overarched, and echoing walks between:<br>
      There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,<br>
      Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds<br>
      At loop-holes cut through thickest shade. Those leaves<br>
      They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe,<br>
      And with what skill they had together sewed,<br>
      To gird their waist—vain covering, if to hide<br>
      Their guilt and dreaded shame! O how unlike<br>
      To that first naked glory! Such of late<br>
      Columbus found the American, so girt<br>
      With feathered <span class="tooltip">cincture<span class="tooltiptext">a girdle or belt.</span></span>, naked else and wild,<br>
      Among the trees on isles and woody shores.<br>
      Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part<br>
      Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,<br>
      They sat them down to weep. Nor only tears<br>
      Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within<br>
      Began to rise, high passions—anger, hate,<br>
      Mistrust, suspicion, discord—and shook sore<br>
      Their inward state of mind, calm region once<br>
      And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:<br>
      For Understanding ruled not, and the Will<br>
      Heard not her lore, both in subjection now<br>
      To sensual Appetite, who, from beneath<br>
      Usurping over sovran Reason, claimed<br>
      Superior sway. From thus distempered breast<br>
      Adam, estranged in look and altered style,<br>
      Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and stayed<br>
      With me, as I besought thee, when that strange<br>
      Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,<br>
      I know not whence possessed thee! We had then<br>
      Remained still happy—not, as now, despoiled<br>
      Of all our good, shamed, naked, miserable!<br>
      Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve<br>
      The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek<br>
      Such proof, conclude they then begin to fail.”
      </p>

      <p>
        To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve:—<br>
      “What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe?<br>
      Imput’st thou that to my default, or will<br>
      Of wandering, as thou call’st it, which who knows<br>
      But might as ill have happened thou being by,<br>
      Or to thyself perhaps? Hadst thou been there,<br>
      Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned<br>
      Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;<br>
      No ground of enmity between us known<br>
      Why he should mean me ill or seek to harm;<br>
      Was I to have never parted from thy side?<br>
      As good have grown there still, a lifeless rib.<br>
      Being as I am, why didst not thou, the Head,<br>
      Command me absolutely not to go,<br>
      Going into such danger, as thou saidst?<br>
      Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay,<br>
      Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.<br>
      Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,<br>
      Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied:—<br>
      “Is this the love, is this the recompense<br>
      Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, expressed<br>
      Immutable when thou wert lost, not I—<br>
      Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,<br>
      Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?<br>
      And am I now upbraided as the cause<br>
      Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,<br>
      It seems, in thy restraint! What could I more?<br>
      I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold<br>
      The danger, and the lurking Enemy<br>
      That lay in wait; beyond this had been force,<br>
      And force upon free will hath here no place.<br>
      But confidence then bore thee on, secure<br>
      Either to meet no danger, or to find<br>
      Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps<br>
      I also erred in overmuch admiring<br>
      What seemed in thee so perfet that I thought<br>
      No evil durst attempt thee, But I rue<br>
      That error now, which is become my crime,<br>
      And thou the accuser. Thus it shall befall<br>
      Him who, to worth in women overtrusting,<br>
      Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;<br>
      And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,<br>
      She first his weak indulgence will accuse.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus they in mutual accusation spent<br>
      The fruitless hours, but neither self—condemning;<br>
      And of their vain contest’ appeared no end.
