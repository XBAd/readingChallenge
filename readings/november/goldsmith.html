      <h2>The Deserted Village</h2>

      <p>
        SWEET Auburn! loveliest village of the plain, <br>
        Where health and plenty cheer’d the labouring swain,<br>
        Where smiling Spring its earliest visit paid,<br>
        And parting Summer’s lingering blooms delay’d;<br>
        Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,<br>
        Seats of my youth, when every sport could please:<br>
        How often have I loiter’d o’er thy green,<br>
        Where humble happiness endear’d each scene!<br>
        How often have I paused on every charm,<br>
        The shelter’d cot, the cultivated farm,<br>
        The never-failing brook, the busy mill,<br>
        The decent church that topp’d the neighbouring hill;<br>
        The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,<br>
        For talking age and whispering lovers made!<br>
        How often have I bless’d the coming day,<br>
        When toil, remitting, lent its turn to play,<br>
        And all the village train, from labour free,<br>
        Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree!
      </p>

      <p>
        While many a pastime circled in the shade,<br>
        The young contending as the old survey’d;<br>
        And many a gambol frolick’d o’er the ground,<br>
        And sleights of art and feats of strength went round;<br>
        And still, as each repeated pleasure tired,<br>
        Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired—<br>
        The dancing pair that simply sought renown,<br>
        By holding out to tire each other down;<br>
        The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,<br>
        While secret laughter titter’d round the place;<br>
        The bashful virgin’s side-long looks of love;<br>
        The matron’s glance, that would those looks reprove.<br>
        These were thy charms, sweet village! sports like these,<br>
        With sweet succession, taught e’en toil to please;<br>
        These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed;<br>
        These were thy charms—but all these charms are fled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,<br>
      Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;<br>
      Amidst thy bowers the tyrant’s hand is seen,<br>
      And Desolation saddens all thy green:<br>
      One only master grasps the whole domain,<br>
      And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain.<br>
      No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,<br>
      But, choked with sedges, works its weedy way;<br>
      Along thy glades, a solitary guest,<br>
      The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;<br>
      Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,<br>
      And tires their echoes with unvaried cries:<br>
      Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,<br>
      And the long grass o’ertops the mouldering wall;<br>
      And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler’s hand,<br>
      Far, far away thy children leave the land.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,<br>
      Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.<br>
      princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;<br>
      A breath can make them, as a breath has made:<br>
      But a bold peasantry, their country’s pride,<br>
      When once destroy’d, can never be supplied.
      </p>

      <p>
        A time there was, ere England’s griefs began,<br>
      When every rood of ground maintain’d its man;<br>
      For him light Labour spread her wholesome store,<br>
      Just gave what life required, but gave no more:<br>
      His best companions, Innocence and Health;<br>
      And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.
      </p>

      <p>
        But times are alter’d; Trade’s unfeeling train<br>
      Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain;<br>
      Along the lawn, where scatter’d hamlets rose,<br>
      Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;<br>
      And every want to luxury allied,<br>
      And every pang that folly pays to pride.<br>
      Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,<br>
      Those calm desires that ask’d but little room,<br>
      Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,<br>
      Lived in each look, and brighten’d all the green—<br>
      These, far departing, seek a kinder shore,<br>
      And rural mirth and manners are no more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sweet Auburn! parent of the blissful hour,<br>
      Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant’s power.<br>
      Here, as I take my solitary rounds,<br>
      Amidst thy tangling walks and ruin’d grounds,<br>
      And, many a year elapsed, return to view<br>
      Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew—<br>
      Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,<br>
      Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        In all my wanderings through this world of care,<br>
      In all my griefs—and God has given my share—<br>
      I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,<br>
      Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;<br>
      To husband out life’s taper at the close,<br>
      And keep the flame from wasting, by repose:<br>
      I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,<br>
      Amidst the swains to show my book-learn’d skill,<br>
      Around my fire an evening group to draw,<br>
      And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;<br>
      And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,<br>
      Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,<br>
      I still had hopes, my long vexations past,<br>
      Here to return—and die at home at last.
      </p>

      <p>
        O blest retirement, friend to life’s decline,<br>
      Retreats from care, that never must be mine,<br>
      How blest is he who crowns, in shades like these,<br>
      A youth of labour with an age of ease;<br>
      Who quits a world where strong temptations try,<br>
      And, since ’tis hard to combat, learns to fly!<br>
      For him no wretches, born to work and weep,<br>
      Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;<br>
      No surly porter stands, in guilty state,<br>
      To spurn imploring famine from the gate;<br>
      But on he moves to meet his latter end,<br>
      Angels around befriending virtue’s friend;<br>
      Sinks to the grave with unperceived decay,<br>
      While resignation gently slopes the way;<br>
      And, all his prospects brightening to the last,<br>
      His heaven commences ere the world be past!
      </p>

      <p>
        Sweet was the sound, when oft, at evening’s close,<br>
      Up yonder hill the village murmur rose.<br>
      There, as I pass’d with careless steps and slow,<br>
      The mingled notes came soften’d from below;<br>
      The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,<br>
      The sober herd that low’d to meet their young,<br>
      The noisy geese that gabbled o’er the pool,<br>
      The playful children just let loose from school;<br>
      The watch dog’s voice that bay’d the whispering wind,<br>
      And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;—<br>
      These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,<br>
      And fill’d each pause the nightingale had made.<br>
      But now the sounds of population fail,<br>
      No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,<br>
      No busy steps the grass-grown footway tread<br>
      But all the bloomy flush of life is fled—<br>
      All but yon widow’d, solitary thing,<br>
      That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;<br>
      She, wretched matron,—forced, in age, for bread,<br>
      To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,<br>
      To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,<br>
      To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn,—<br>
      She only left of all the harmless train,<br>
      The sad historian of the pensive plain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,<br>
      And still where many a garden-flower grows wild,<br>
      There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,<br>
      The village preacher’s modest mansion rose.<br>
      A man he was to all the country dear,<br>
      And passing rich with forty pounds a year.<br>
      Remote from towns he ran his godly race,<br>
      Nor e’er had changed, nor wish’d to change, his place;<br>
      Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for power<br>
      By doctrines fashion’d to the varying hour;<br>
      Far other aims his heart had learn’d to prize,<br>
      More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.<br>
      His house was known to all the vagrant train;<br>
      He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;<br>
      The long-remember’d beggar was his guest,<br>
      Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;<br>
      The ruin’d spendthrift, now no longer proud,<br>
      Claim’d kindred there, and had his claims allow’d;<br>
      The broken soldier, kindly bid to stay,<br>
      Sat by his fire, and talk’d the night away;—<br>
      Wept o’er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,<br>
      Shoulder’d his crutch, and show’d how fields were won.<br>
      Pleased with his guests, the good man learn’d to glow,<br>
      And quite forgot their vices in their woe;<br>
      Careless their merits or their faults to scan,<br>
      His pity gave ere charity began.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,<br>
      And even his failings lean’d to virtue’s side;<br>
      But in his duty prompt at every call,<br>
      He watch’d and wept, he pray’d and felt for all:<br>
      And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,<br>
      To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,<br>
      He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,<br>
      Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside the bed where parting life was laid,<br>
      And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay’d,<br>
      The reverend champion stood. At his control,<br>
      Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;<br>
      Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,<br>
      And his last faltering accents whisper’d praise.
      </p>

      <p>
        At church, with meek and unaffected grace,<br>
      His looks adorn’d the venerable place;<br>
      Truth from his lips prevail’d with double sway,<br>
      And fools, who came to scoff, remain’d to pray.<br>
      The service past, around the pious man<br>
      With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;<br>
      E’en children follow’d, with endearing wile,<br>
      And pluck’d his gown, to share the good man’s smile;<br>
      His ready smile a parent’s warmth express’d;<br>
      Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distress’d;<br>
      To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given<br>
      But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.<br>
      As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,<br>
      Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,<br>
      Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,<br>
      Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,<br>
      With blossom’d furze unprofitably gay,<br>
      There, in his noisy mansion, skill’d to rule,<br>
      The village master taught his little school.<br>
      A man severe he was, and stern to view;<br>
      I knew him well, and every truant knew:<br>
      Well had the boding tremblers learn’d to trace<br>
      The day’s disasters in his morning face;<br>
      Full well they laugh’d with counterfeited glee<br>
      At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;<br>
      Full well the busy whisper, circling round,<br>
      Convey’d the dismal tidings when he frown’d.<br>
      Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught,<br>
      The love he bore to learning was in fault.<br>
      The village all declared how much he knew;<br>
      ’Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;<br>
      Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,<br>
      And even the story ran that he could gauge.<br>
      In arguing, too, the parson own’d his skill,<br>
      For even though vanquish’d, he could argue still;<br>
      While words of learned length and thundering sound<br>
      Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;<br>
      And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,<br>
      That one small head could carry all he knew.<br>
      But past is all his fame;—the very spot<br>
      Where many a time he triumph’d, is forgot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,<br>
      Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,<br>
      Now lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,<br>
      Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retired,<br>
      Where village statesmen talk’d with looks profound,<br>
      And news much older than their ale went round.<br>
      Imagination fondly stoops to trace<br>
      The parlour splendours of that festive place;<br>
      The whitewash’d wall, the nicely sanded floor,<br>
      The varnish’d clock that click’d behind the door,<br>
      The chest, contrived a double debt to pay,<br>
      A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day,<br>
      The pictures placed for ornament and use,<br>
      The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose,<br>
      The hearth, except when winter chill’d the day,<br>
      With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;—<br>
      While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,<br>
      Ranged o’er the chimney, glisten’d in a row.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vain transitory splendours! Could not all<br>
      Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall?<br>
      Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart<br>
      An hour’s importance to the poor man’s heart.<br>
      Thither no more the peasant shall repair,<br>
      To sweet oblivion of his daily care;<br>
      No more the farmer’s news, the barber’s tale,<br>
      No more the woodman’s ballad shall prevail;<br>
      No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,<br>
      Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;<br>
      The host himself no longer shall be found<br>
      Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;<br>
      Nor the coy maid, half willing to be prest,<br>
      Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,<br>
      These simple blessings of the lowly train;<br>
      To me more dear, congenial to my heart,<br>
      One native charm, than all the gloss of art.<br>
      Spontaneous joys, where nature has its play,<br>
      The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;<br>
      Lightly they frolic o’er the vacant mind,<br>
      Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined:<br>
      But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,<br>
      With all the freaks of wanton wealth array’d,<br>
      In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,<br>
      The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;<br>
      And, even while Fashion’s brightest arts decoy,<br>
      The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey<br>
      The rich man’s joys increase, the poor’s decay,<br>
      ’Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand<br>
      Between a splendid and a happy land.<br>
      Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,<br>
      And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;<br>
      Hoards, even beyond the miser’s wish, abound,<br>
      And rich men flock from all the world around.<br>
      Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name<br>
      That leaves our useful products still the same.<br>
      Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride<br>
      Takes up a space that many poor supplied;<br>
      Space for his lake, his park’s extended bounds,<br>
      Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;<br>
      The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,<br>
      Has robb’d the neighbouring fields of half their growth;<br>
      His seat, where solitary sports are seen,<br>
      Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;<br>
      Around the world each needful product flies,<br>
      For all the luxuries the world supplies;<br>
      While thus the land, adorn’d for pleasure all,<br>
      In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.
      </p>

      <p>
        As some fair female, unadorn’d and plain,<br>
      Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,<br>
      Slights every borrow’d charm that dress supplies,<br>
      Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;<br>
      But when those charms are past, for charms are frail,<br>
      When time advances, and when lovers fail,<br>
      She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,<br>
      In all the glaring impotence of dress;<br>
      Thus fares the land by luxury betray’d;<br>
      In nature’s simplest charms at first array’d;—<br>
      But verging to decline, its splendours rise,<br>
      Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;<br>
      While, scourged by famine, from the smiling land<br>
      The mournful peasant leads his humble band;<br>
      And while he sinks, without one arm to save,<br>
      The country blooms—a garden and a grave!
      </p>

      <p>
        Where, then, ah! where shall poverty reside,<br>
      To ’scape the pressure of contiguous pride?<br>
      If to some common’s fenceless limits stray’d,<br>
      He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,<br>
      Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,<br>
      And even the bare-worn common is denied.
      </p>

      <p>
        If to the city sped—what waits him there?<br>
      To see profusion that he must not share;<br>
      To see ten thousand baneful arts combined<br>
      To pamper luxury and thin mankind;<br>
      To see each joy the sons of pleasure know<br>
      Extorted from his fellow-creature’s woe:<br>
      Here while the courtier glitters in brocade,<br>
      There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;<br>
      Here while the proud their long-drawn pomp display,<br>
      There the black gibbet glooms beside the way:<br>
      The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign,<br>
      Here, richly deck’d, admits the gorgeous train;<br>
      Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,<br>
      The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.<br>
      Sure scenes like these no troubles e’er annoy!<br>
      Sure these denote one universal joy!—<br>
      Are these thy serious thoughts?—Ah, turn thine eyes<br>
      Where the poor houseless shivering female lies:<br>
      She once, perhaps, in village plenty bless’d,<br>
      Has wept at tales of innocence distress’d;<br>
      Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,<br>
      Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:<br>
      Now lost to all, her friends, her virtue, fled,<br>
      Near her betrayer’s door she lays her head,<br>
      And, pinch’d with cold, and shrinking from the shower,<br>
      With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,<br>
      When idly first, ambitious of the town,<br>
      She left her wheel, and robes of country brown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do thine, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest train,<br>
      Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?<br>
      E’en now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,<br>
      At proud men’s doors they ask a little bread!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene,<br>
      Where half the convex world intrudes between,<br>
      Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,<br>
      Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.<br>
      Far different there from all that charm’d before,<br>
      The various terrors of that horrid shore;<br>
      Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,<br>
      And fiercely shed intolerable day;<br>
      Those matted woods where birds forget to sing,<br>
      But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;<br>
      Those poisonous fields, with rank luxuriance crown’d,<br>
      Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;<br>
      Where at each step the stranger fears to wake<br>
      The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;<br>
      Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,<br>
      And savage men more murderous still than they:<br>
      While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,<br>
      Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.<br>
      Far different these from every former scene,<br>
      The cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,<br>
      The breezy covert of the warbling grove,<br>
      That only shelter’d thefts of harmless love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good Heaven! what sorrows gloom’d that parting day,<br>
      That call’d them from their native walks away;<br>
      When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,<br>
      Hung round their bowers, and fondly looked their last,<br>
      And took a long farewell, and wish’d in vain,<br>
      For seats like these beyond the western main;<br>
      And shuddering still to face the distant deep,<br>
      Return’d and wept, and still return’d to weep!<br>
      The good old sire the first prepared to go<br>
      To new-found worlds, and wept for others’ woe;<br>
      But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,<br>
      He only wish’d for worlds beyond the grave.<br>
      His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,<br>
      The fond companion of his helpless years,<br>
      Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,<br>
      And left a lover’s for a father’s arms.<br>
      With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,<br>
      And bless’d the cot where every pleasure rose,<br>
      And kiss’d her thoughtless babes with many a tear,<br>
      And clasp’d them close, in sorrow doubly dear;<br>
      Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief<br>
      In all the silent manliness of grief.

      <p>
        O Luxury, thou cursed by Heaven’s decree,<br>
      How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!<br>
      How do thy potions, with insidious joy,<br>
      Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy!<br>
      Kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown,<br>
      Boast of a florid vigour not their own;<br>
      At every draught more large and large they grow,<br>
      A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;<br>
      Till sapp’d their strength, and every part unsound,<br>
      Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round.
      </p>

      <p>
        E’en now the devastation is begun,<br>
      And half the business of destruction done;<br>
      E’en now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,<br>
      I see the rural Virtues leave the land.<br>
      Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail<br>
      That idly waiting flaps with every gale,<br>
      Downward they move, a melancholy band,<br>
      Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand;<br>
      Contented Toil, and hospitable Care,<br>
      And kind connubial Tenderness are there;<br>
      And Piety with wishes placed above,<br>
      And steady Loyalty, and faithful Love.
      </p>

      <p>
        And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid<br>
      Still first to fly where sensual joys invade!<br>
      Unfit, in these degenerate times of shame,<br>
      To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;<br>
      Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,<br>
      My shame in crowds, my solitary pride;<br>
      Thou source of all my bliss and all my woe,<br>
      That found’st me poor at first, and keep’st me so;<br>
      Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,<br>
      Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!<br>
      Farewell! and oh! where’er thy voice be tried,<br>
      On Torno’s cliffs, or Pambamarca’s side,<br>
      Whether where equinoctial fervours glow,<br>
      Or winter wraps the polar world in snow,<br>
      Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,<br>
      Redress the rigours of th’ inclement clime;<br>
      Aid slighted Truth with thy persuasive strain;<br>
      Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;<br>
      Teach him that states of native strength possest,<br>
      Though very poor, may still be very blest;<br>
      That Trade’s proud empire hastes to swift decay,<br>
      As ocean sweeps the labour’d mole away;<br>
      While self-dependent power can time defy<br>
      As rocks resist the billows and the sky.
