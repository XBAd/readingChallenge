          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Regained" target="_blank">Paradise Regained</a>
           is a poem by English poet John Milton, first published in 1671.
           <em>Paradise Regained</em> is connected by name to his earlier and
           more famous epic poem <em>Paradise Lost</em>, with which it shares
           similar theological themes; indeed, its title, its use of blank verse,
           and its progression through Christian history recall the earlier work.
           However, this effort deals primarily with the temptation of Christ as
           recounted in the <em>Gospel of Luke</em>. Paradise Regained is
           four books long and comprises 2,065 lines; in contrast, Paradise Lost is
           twelve books long and comprises 10,565 lines. Whereas Paradise Lost is ornate
           in style and decorative in its verse, Paradise Regained is carried out in a
           fairly plain style. Specifically, Milton reduces his use of simile and
           deploys a simpler syntax in Paradise Regained than he does in Paradise Lost,
           and this is consistent with Jesus's sublime plainness in his life and
           teachings.

      <h2>The First Book</h2>

      <p>
        I, WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung <br>
        By one man’s disobedience lost, now sing <br>
        Recovered Paradise to all mankind,<br>
        By one man’s firm obedience fully tried<br>
        Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled<br>
        In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,<br>
        And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thou Spirit, who led’st this glorious <span class="tooltip">Eremite<span class="tooltiptext">a Christian hermit or recluse.</span></span><br>
      Into the desert, his victorious field<br>
      Against the spiritual foe, and brought’st him thence<br>
      By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,<br>
      As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,<br>
      And bear through highth or depth of Nature’s bounds,<br>
      With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds<br>
      Above heroic, though in secret done,<br>
      And unrecorded left through many an age:<br>
      Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice<br>
      More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried<br>
      Repentance, and Heaven’s kingdom night at hand<br>
      To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked<br>
      With awe the regions round, and with them came<br>
      From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed<br>
      To the flood Jordan—came as then obscure,<br>
      Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon<br>
      Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore<br>
      As to his worthier, and would have resigned<br>
      To him his heavenly office. Nor was long<br>
      His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized<br>
      Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove<br>
      The Spirit descended, while the Father’s voice<br>
      From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.<br>
      That heard the Adversary, who, roving still<br>
      About the world, at that assembly famed<br>
      Would not be last, and, with the voice divine<br>
      Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom<br>
      Such high attest was given a while surveyed<br>
      With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,<br>
      Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air<br>
      To council summons all his mighty Peers,<br>
      Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,<br>
      A gloomy <span class="tooltip">consistory<span class="tooltiptext">a solemn assembly; a church tribunal or governing body</span></span>; and them amidst,<br>
      With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World<br>
      (For much more willingly I mention Air,<br>
      This our old conquest, than remember Hell,<br>
      Our hated habitation), well ye know<br>
      How many ages, as the years of men,<br>
      This Universe we have possessed, and ruled<br>
      In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,<br>
      Since Adam and his facile consort Eve<br>
      Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since<br>
      With dread attending when that fatal wound<br>
      Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve<br>
      Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven<br>
      Delay, for longest time to Him is short;<br>
      And now, too soon for us, the circling hours<br>
      This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we<br>
      Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound<br>
      (At least, if so we can, and by the head<br>
      Broken be not intended all our power<br>
      To be infringed, our freedom and our being<br>
      In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)—<br>
      For this ill news I bring: The Woman’s Seed,<br>
      Destined to this, is late of woman born.<br>
      His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;<br>
      But his growth now to youth’s full power, displaying<br>
      All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve<br>
      Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.<br>
      Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim<br>
      His coming, is sent harbinger, who all<br>
      Invites, and in the consecrated stream<br>
      Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so<br>
      Purified to receive him pure, or rather<br>
      To do him honour as their King. All come,<br>
      And he himself among them was baptized—<br>
      Not thence to be more pure, but to receive<br>
      The testimony of Heaven, that who he is<br>
      Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw<br>
      The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising<br>
      Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds<br>
      Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head<br>
      A perfect Dove descend (whate’er it meant);<br>
      And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,<br>
      “This is my Son beloved,—in him am pleased.’<br>
      His mother, then, is mortal, but his Sire<br>
      He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;<br>
      And what will He not do to advance his Son?<br>
      His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,<br>
      When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;<br>
      Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems<br>
      In all his lineaments, though in his face<br>
      The glimpses of his Father’s glory shine.<br>
      Ye see our danger on the utmost edge<br>
      Of hazard, which admits no long debate,<br>
      But must with something sudden be opposed<br>
      (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),<br>
      Ere in the head of nations he appear,<br>
      Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.<br>
      I, when no other durst, sole undertook<br>
      The dismal expedition to find out<br>
      And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed<br>
      Successfully: a calmer voyage now<br>
      Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once<br>
      Induces best to hope of like success.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He ended, and his words impression left<br>
      Of much amazement to the infernal crew,<br>
      Distracted and surprised with deep dismay<br>
      At these sad tidings. But no time was then<br>
      For long indulgence to their fears or grief:<br>
      Unanimous they all commit the care<br>
      And management of this main enterprise<br>
      To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt<br>
      At first against mankind so well had thrived<br>
      In Adam’s overthrow, and led their march<br>
      From Hell’s deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,<br>
      Regents, and <span class="tooltip">potentates<span class="tooltiptext">a monarch or ruler, especially an autocratic one.</span></span>, and kings, yea gods,<br>
      Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.<br>
      So to the coast of Jordan he directs<br>
      His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,<br>
      Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,<br>
      This man of men, attested Son of God,<br>
      Temptation and all guile on him to try—<br>
      So to subvert whom he suspected raised<br>
      To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:<br>
      But, contrary, <span class="tooltip">unweeting<span class="tooltiptext">Obsolete form of unwitting; unaware or unintentional</span></span> he fulfilled<br>
      The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,<br>
      Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright<br>
      Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,<br>
      Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth<br>
      With Man or men’s affairs, how I begin<br>
      To verify that solemn message late,<br>
      On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure<br>
      In Galilee, that she should bear a son,<br>
      Great in renown, and called the Son of God.<br>
      Then told’st her, doubting how these things could be<br>
      To her a virgin, that on her should come<br>
      The Holy Ghosts, and the power of the Highest<br>
      O’ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown,<br>
      To shew him worthy of his birth divine<br>
      And high prediction, henceforth I expose<br>
      To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay<br>
      His utmost subtlety, because he boasts<br>
      And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng<br>
      Of his <span class="tooltip">Apostasy<span class="tooltiptext">an act of refusing to continue to follow, obey, or recognize a religious faith; abandonment of a previous loyalty</span></span>. He might have learnt<br>
      Less <span class="tooltip">overweening<span class="tooltiptext">showing excessive confidence or pride.</span></span>, since he failed in Job,<br>
      Whose constant perseverance overcame<br>
      Whate’er his cruel malice could invent.<br>
      He now shall know I can produce a man,<br>
      Of female seed, far abler to resist<br>
      All his solicitations, and at length<br>
      All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell—<br>
      Winning by conquest what the first man lost<br>
      By fallacy surprised. But first I mean<br>
      To exercise him in the Wilderness;<br>
      There he shall first lay down the rudiments<br>
      Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth<br>
      To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.<br>
      By humiliation and strong sufferance<br>
      His weakness shall o’ercome Satanic strength,<br>
      And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;<br>
      That all the Angels and æthereal Powers—<br>
      They now, and men hereafter—may discern<br>
      From what consummate virtue I have chose<br>
      This perfet man, by merit called my Son,<br>
      To earn salvation for the sons of men.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven<br>
      Admiring stood a space; then into hymns<br>
      Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,<br>
      Circling the throne and singing, while the hand<br>
      Sung with the voice, and this the argument:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Victory and triumph to the Son of God,<br>
      Now entering his great duel, not of arms<br>
      But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!<br>
      The Father knows the Son; therefore secure<br>
      Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,<br>
      Against whate’er may tempt, whate’er seduce,<br>
      Allure, or terrify, or undermine.<br>
      Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,<br>
      And, devilish machinations, come to nought!”
      </p>

      <p>
        So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.<br>
      Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days<br>
      Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,<br>
      Musing and much revolving in his breast<br>
      How best the mighty work he might begin<br>
      Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first<br>
      Publish his godlike office now mature,<br>
      One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading<br>
      And his deep thoughts, the better to converse<br>
      With solitude, till, far from track of men,<br>
      Thought following thought, and step by step led on,<br>
      He entered now the bordering Desert wild,<br>
      And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,<br>
      His holy meditations thus pursued:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “O what a multitude of thoughts at once<br>
      Awakened in me swarm, while I consider<br>
      What from within I feel myself, and hear<br>
      What from without comes often to my ears,<br>
      Ill sorting with my present state compared!<br>
      When I was yet a child, no childish play<br>
      To me was pleasing; all my mind was set<br>
      Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,<br>
      What might be public good; myself I thought<br>
      Born to that end, born to promote all truth,<br>
      All righteous things. Therefore, above my years,<br>
      The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;<br>
      Made it my whole delight, and in it grew<br>
      To such perfection that, ere yet my age<br>
      Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast<br>
      I went into the Temple, there to hear<br>
      The teachers of our Law, and to propose<br>
      What might improve my knowledge or their own,<br>
      And was admired by all. Yet this not all<br>
      To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds<br>
      Flamed in my heart, heroic acts—one while<br>
      To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;<br>
      Then to subdue and quell, o’er all the earth,<br>
      Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,<br>
      Till truth were freed, and equity restored:<br>
      Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first<br>
      By winning words to conquer willing hearts,<br>
      And make persuasion do the work of fear;<br>
      At least to try, and teach the erring soul,<br>
      Not wilfully misdoing, but unware<br>
      Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.<br>
      These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,<br>
      By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,<br>
      And said to me apart, ‘High are thy thoughts,<br>
      O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar<br>
      To what highth sacred virtue and true worth<br>
      Can raise them, though above example high;<br>
      By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.<br>
      For know, thou art no son of mortal man;<br>
      Though men esteem thee low of parentage,<br>
      Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules<br>
      All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men<br>
      A messenger from God foretold thy birth<br>
      Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold<br>
      Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David’s throne,<br>
      And of thy kingdom there should be no end.<br>
      At thy Nativity a glorious quire<br>
      Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung<br>
      To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,<br>
      And told them the Messiah now was born,<br>
      Where they might see him; and to thee they came,<br>
      Directed to the manger where thou lay’st;<br>
      For in the inn was left no better room.<br>
      A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,<br>
      Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,<br>
      To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;<br>
      By whose bright course led on they found the place,<br>
      Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,<br>
      By which they knew thee King of Israel born.<br>
      Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned<br>
      By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,<br>
      Before the altar and the vested priest.<br>
      Like things of thee to all that present stood.’<br>
      This having heard, straight I again revolved<br>
      The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ<br>
      Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes<br>
      Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake<br>
      I am—this chiefly, that my way must lie<br>
      Through many a hard assay, even to the death,<br>
      Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,<br>
      Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins’<br>
      Full weight must be transferred upon my head.<br>
      Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,<br>
      The time prefixed I waited; when behold<br>
      The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,<br>
      Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come<br>
      Before Messiah, and his way prepare!<br>
      I, as all others, to his baptism came,<br>
      Which I believed was from above; but he<br>
      Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed<br>
      Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)—<br>
      Me him whose harbinger he was; and first<br>
      Refused on me baptism to confer,<br>
      As much his greater, and was hardly won.<br>
      But, as I rose out of the <span class="tooltip">laving<span class="tooltiptext">washing; cleansing</span></span> stream,<br>
      Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence<br>
      The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;<br>
      And last, the sum of all, my Father’s voice,<br>
      Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,<br>
      Me his belovèd Son, in whom alone<br>
      He was well pleased: by which I knew the time<br>
      Now full, that I no more should live obscure,<br>
      But openly begin, as best becomes<br>
      The authority which I derived from Heaven.<br>
      And now by some strong motion I am led<br>
      Into this wilderness; to what intent<br>
      I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know;<br>
      For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,<br>
      And, looking round, on every side beheld<br>
      A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.<br>
      The way he came, not having marked return,<br>
      Was difficult, by human steps untrod;<br>
      And he still on was led, but with such thoughts<br>
      Accompanied of things past and to come<br>
      Lodged in his breast as well might recommend<br>
      Such solitude before choicest society.
      </p>

      <p>
        Full forty days he passed—whether on hill<br>
      Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night<br>
      Under the covert of some ancient oak<br>
      Or ceder to defend him from the dew,<br>
      Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;<br>
      Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,<br>
      Till those days ended; hungered then at last<br>
      Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild,<br>
      Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk<br>
      The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;<br>
      The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.<br>
      But now an aged man in rural weeds,<br>
      Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray ewe,<br>
      Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve<br>
      Against a winter’s day, when winds blow keen,<br>
      To warm him wet returned from field at eve,<br>
      He saw approach; who first with curious eye<br>
      Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:—
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,<br>
      So far from path or road of men, who pass<br>
      In troop or caravan, for single none<br>
      Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here<br>
      His carcass, pined with hunger and with drought.<br>
      I ask the rather, and the more admire,<br>
      For that to me thou seem’st the man whom late<br>
      Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford<br>
      Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son<br>
      Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes<br>
      Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth<br>
      To town or village nigh (nighest is far),<br>
      Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,<br>
      What happens new; fame also finds us out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        To whom the Son of God:—“Who brought me hither<br>
      Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “By miracle he may,” replied the swain;<br>
      ‘What other way I see not; for we here<br>
      Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured<br>
      More than the camel, and to drink go far—<br>
      Men to much misery and hardship born.<br>
      But, if thou be the Son of God, command<br>
      That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;<br>
      So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve<br>
      With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He ended, and the Son of God replied:—<br>
      “Think’st thou such force in bread? Is it not written<br>
      (For I discern thee other than thou seem’st),<br>
      Man lives not by bread only, but each word<br>
      Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed<br>
      Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount<br>
      Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;<br>
      And forty days Eliah without food<br>
      Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.<br>
      Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust,<br>
      Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?”

        Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:—<br>
      “’Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate<br>
      Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,<br>
      Kept not my happy station, but was driven<br>
      With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep—<br>
      Yet to that hideous place not so confined<br>
      By rigour unconniving but that oft,<br>
      Leaving my <span class="tooltip">dolorous<span class="tooltiptext">causing, marked by, or expressing misery or grief</span></span> prison, I enjoy<br>
      Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,<br>
      Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens<br>
      Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.<br>
      I came, among the Sons of God, when he<br>
      Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,<br>
      To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;<br>
      And, when to all his Angels he proposed<br>
      To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,<br>
      That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,<br>
      I undertook that office, and the tongues<br>
      Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies<br>
      To his destruction, as I had in charge:<br>
      For what he bids I do. Though I have lost<br>
      Much lustre of my native brightness, lost<br>
      To be beloved of God, I have not lost<br>
      To love, at least contemplate and admire,<br>
      What I see excellent in good, or fair,<br>
      Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.<br>
      What can be then less in me than desire<br>
      To see thee and approach thee, whom I know<br>
      Declared the Son of God, to hear attent<br>
      Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?<br>
      Men generally think me much a foe<br>
      To all mankind. Why should I? they to me<br>
      Never did wrong or violence. By them<br>
      I lost not what I lost; rather by them<br>
      I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell<br>
      Copartner in these regions of the World,<br>
      If not disposer—lend them oft my aid,<br>
      Oft my advice by presages and signs,<br>
      And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,<br>
      Whereby they may direct their future life.<br>
      Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain<br>
      Companions of my misery and woe!<br>
      At first it may be; but, long since with woe<br>
      Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof<br>
      That fellowship in pain divides not smart,<br>
      Nor lightens aught each man’s peculiar load;<br>
      Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.<br>
      This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,<br>
      Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more.”

        To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:—<br>
      “Deservedly thou griev’st, composed of lies<br>
      From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,<br>
      Who boast’st release from Hell, and leave to come<br>
      Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com’st indeed,<br>
      As a poor miserable captive thrall<br>
      Comes to the place where he before had sat<br>
      Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,<br>
      Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,<br>
      A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,<br>
      To all the host of Heaven. The happy place<br>
      Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy—<br>
      Rather inflames thy torment, representing<br>
      Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;<br>
      So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.
