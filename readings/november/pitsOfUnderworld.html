        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy" target="_blank"><em>The Divine Comedy</em></a>
           is a long Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308
           and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely
           considered to be the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one
           of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative
           vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view
           as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century.
           It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written
           (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the
           standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts:
           <em>Inferno</em>, <em>Purgatorio</em>, and <em>Paradiso</em>.
           The narrative describes Dante's travels through Hell,
           Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven, while allegorically the poem
           represents the soul's journey towards God. Dante draws on medieval
           Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy
           derived from the <em>Summa Theologica</em> of Thomas Aquinas.
           Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called "the Summa in verse".
           In Dante's work, Virgil is presented as human reason and
           Beatrice is presented as divine knowledge.

      <h2>Inferno [Hell]</h2>

      <h2>Canto III</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—Dante, following Virgil, comes to the gate of Hell; where, after having read the dreadful words that are written thereon, they both enter. Here, as he understands from Virgil, those were punished who had passed their time (for living it could not be called) in a state of apathy and indifference both to good and evil. Then, pursuing their way, they arrive at the river Acheron; and there find the old ferryman Charon, who takes the spirits over to the opposite shore; which, as soon as Dante reaches, he is seized with terror, and falls into a trance.
      </p>

      <p>
        “THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe: <br>
        Through me you pass into eternal pain:<br>
        Through me among the people lost for aye.<br>
        Justice the founder of my fabric moved:<br>
        To rear me was the task of Power divine,<br>
        Supremest Wisdom, and primeval Love.<br>
        Before me things create were none, save things<br>
        Eternal, and eternal I endure.<br>
        All hope abandon, ye who enter here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Such characters, in color dim, I mark’d<br>
      Over a portal’s lofty arch inscribed.<br>
      Whereat I thus: “Master, these words import<br>
      Hard meaning.” He as one prepared replied:<br>
      “Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;<br>
      Here be vile fear extinguish’d. We are come<br>
      Where I have told thee we shall see the souls<br>
      To misery doom’d, who intellectual good<br>
      Have lost.” And when his hand he had stretch’d forth<br>
      To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer’d,<br>
      Into that secret place he led me on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here sighs, with lamentations and loud moans,<br>
      Resounded through the air pierced by no star,<br>
      That e’en I wept at entering. Various tongues,<br>
      Horrible languages, outcries of woe,<br>
      Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,<br>
      With hands together smote that swell’d the sounds,<br>
      Made up a tumult, that forever whirls<br>
      Round through that air with solid darkness stain’d,<br>
      Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then, with horror yet encompast, cried:<br>
      “O master! what is this I hear? what race<br>
      Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?”
      </p>

      <p>
        He thus to me: “This miserable fate<br>
      Suffer the wretched souls of those, who lived<br>
      Without or praise or blame, with that ill band<br>
      Of angels mix’d, who nor rebellious proved,<br>
      Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves<br>
      Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth<br>
      Not to impair his lustre; nor the depth<br>
      Of Hell receives them, lest the accursed tribe<br>
      Should glory thence with exultation vain.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I then: “Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,<br>
      That they lament so loud?” He straight replied:<br>
      “That will I tell thee briefly. These of death<br>
      No hope may entertain: and their blind life<br>
      So meanly passes, that all other lots<br>
      They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,<br>
      Nor suffers; Mercy and Justice scorn them both.<br>
      Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.”
      </p>

      <p>
        And I, who straightway look’d, beheld a flag,<br>
      Which whirling ran around so rapidly,<br>
      That it no pause obtain’d: and following came<br>
      Such a long train of spirits, I should ne’er<br>
      Have thought that death so many had despoil’d.
      </p>

      <p>
        When some of these I recognized, I saw<br>
      And knew the shade of him, who to base fear<br>
      Yielding, <span class="tooltip">abjured<span class="tooltiptext">solemnly renounce (a belief, cause, or claim).</span></span> his high estate. Forthwith<br>
      I understood, for certain, this the tribe<br>
      Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing<br>
      And to His foes. These wretches, who ne’er lived,<br>
      Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung<br>
      By wasps and hornets, which bedew’d their cheeks<br>
      With blood, that, mix’d with tears, dropp’d to their feet,<br>
      And by disgustful worms was gather’d there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then looking further onwards, I beheld<br>
      A throng upon the shore of a great stream:<br>
      Whereat I thus: “Sir! grant me now to know<br>
      Whom here we view, and whence impell’d they seem<br>
      So eager to pass o’er, as I discern<br>
      Through the blear light?” He thus to me in few:<br>
      “This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive<br>
      Beside the woful tide of Acheron.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then with eyes downward cast, and fill’d with shame,<br>
      Fearing my words offensive to his ear,<br>
      Till we had reach’d the river, I from speech<br>
      Abstain’d. And lo! toward us in a bark<br>
      Comes on an old man, hoary white with eld,<br>
      Crying, “Woe to you, wicked spirits! hope not<br>
      Ever to see the sky again. I come<br>
      To take you to the other shore across,<br>
      Into eternal darkness, there to dwell<br>
      In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there<br>
      Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave<br>
      These who are dead.” But soon as he beheld<br>
      I left them not, “By other way,” said he,<br>
      “By other haven shalt thou come to shore,<br>
      Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat<br>
      Must carry.” Then to him thus spake my guide:<br>
      “Charon! thyself torment not: so ’tis will’d,<br>
      Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks<br>
      Of him, the boatman o’er the livid lake,<br>
      Around whose eyes glared wheeling flames. Meanwhile<br>
      Those spirits, faint and naked, color changed,<br>
      And gnash’d their teeth, soon as the cruel words<br>
      They heard. God and their parents they blasphemed,<br>
      The human kind, the place, the time, and seed,<br>
      That did engender them and give them birth,
      </p>

      <p>
        Then all together sorely wailing drew<br>
      To the curst strand, that every man must pass<br>
      Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,<br>
      With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,<br>
      Beckoning, and each, that lingers, with his oar<br>
      Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves<br>
      One still another following, till the bough<br>
      Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;<br>
      E’en in like manner Adam’s evil brood<br>
      Cast themselves, one by one, down from the shore,<br>
      Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus go they over through the umber’d wave;<br>
      And ever they on the opposing bank<br>
      Be landed, on this side another throng<br>
      Still gathers. “Son,” thus spake the courteous guide,<br>
      “Those who die subject to the wrath of God<br>
      All here together come from every clime<br>
      And to o’erpass the river are not loth:<br>
      For so Heaven’s justice goads them on, that fear<br>
      Is turn’d into desire. Hence ne’er hath past<br>
      Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain,<br>
      Now mayst thou know the import of his words.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This said, the gloomy region trembling shook<br>
      So terribly, that yet with clammy dews<br>
      Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,<br>
      That, lightening, shot forth a <span class="tooltip">vermilion<span class="tooltiptext">a brilliant red color.</span></span> flame,<br>
      Which all my senses conquer’d quite, and I<br>
      Down dropp’d, as one with sudden slumber seized.
      </p>

      <h2>Canto IV</h2>

      <p>
        ARGUMENT.—The Poet, being roused by a clap of thunder, and following his guide onward, descends into Limbo, which is the first circle of Hell, where he finds the souls of those, who although they have lived virtuously and have not to suffer for great sins, nevertheless, through lack of baptism, merit not the bliss of Paradise. Hence he is led on by Virgil to descend into the second circle.
      </p>

      <p>
        BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash<br>
        Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,<br>
        As one by main force roused. Risen upright,<br>
        My rested eyes I moved around, and search’d<br>
        With fixed <span class="tooltip">ken<span class="tooltiptext">sight; range of vision</span></span>, to know what place it was<br>
        Wherein I stood. For certain, on the brink<br>
        I found me of the lamentable <span class="tooltip">vale<span class="tooltiptext">a valley (used in place names or as a poetic term).</span></span>,<br>
        The dread abyss, that joins a thunderous sound<br>
        Of <span class="tooltip">plaints<span class="tooltiptext">complaints; lamentations</span></span> innumerable. Dark and deep,<br>
        And thick with clouds o’erspread, mine eye in vain<br>
        Explored its bottom, nor could aught discern.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Now let us to the blind world there beneath<br>
      Descend,” the bard began, all pale of look:<br>
      “I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I, his alter’d hue perceiving, thus:<br>
      “How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,<br>
      Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?”
      </p>

      <p>
        He then: “The anguish of that race below<br>
      With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear<br>
      Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way<br>
      Urges to haste.” Onward, this said, he moved;<br>
      And entering led me with him, on the bounds<br>
      Of the first circle that surrounds the abyss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard<br>
      Except of sighs, that made the eternal air<br>
      Tremble, not caused by tortures, but from grief<br>
      Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,<br>
      Of men, women, and infants. Then to me<br>
      The gentle guide: “Inquirest thou not what spirits<br>
      Are these which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass<br>
      Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin<br>
      Were blameless; and if aught they merited,<br>
      If profits not, since baptism was not heirs,<br>
      The portal to thy faith. If they before<br>
      The Gospel lived, they served not God aright;<br>
      And among such am I. For these defects,<br>
      And for no other evil, we are lost;<br>
      Only so far afflicted, that we live<br>
      Desiring without hope.” Sore grief assail’d<br>
      My heart at hearing this, for well I knew<br>
      Suspended in that Limbo many a soul<br>
      Of mighty worth. “O tell me, sire revered!<br>
      Tell me, my master!” I began, through wish<br>
      Of full assurance in that holy faith<br>
      Which vanquishes all error; “say, did e’er<br>
      Any, or through his own or other’s merit,<br>
      Come forth from thence, who afterward was blest?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Piercing the secret purport of my speech,<br>
      He answer’d: “I was new to that estate<br>
      When I beheld a <span class="tooltip">puissant<span class="tooltiptext">having great power or influence.</span></span> one arrive<br>
      Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown’d.<br>
      He forth the shade of our first parent drew,<br>
      Abel, his child, and Noah righteous man,<br>
      Of Moses lawgiver for faith approved,<br>
      Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,<br>
      Israel with his sire and with his sons,<br>
      Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,<br>
      And others many more, whom He to bliss<br>
      Exalted. Before these, be thou assured,<br>
      No spirit of human kind was ever saved.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We, while he spake, ceased not our onward road,<br>
      Still passing through the wood; for so I name<br>
      Those spirits thick beset. We were not far<br>
      On this side from the summit, when I kenn’d<br>
      A flame, that o’er the darken’d hemisphere<br>
      Prevailing shined. Yet we a little space<br>
      Were distant, not so far but I in part<br>
      Discover’d that a tribe in honour high<br>
      That placed possess’d. “O thou, who every art<br>
      And science valuest! who are these, that boast<br>
      Such honor, separate from all the rest?”
      </p>

      <p>
        He answer’d: “The renown of their great names,<br>
      That echoes through your world above, acquires<br>
      Favor in Heaven, which holds them thus advanced.”<br>
      Meantime a voice I heard: “Honor the bard<br>
      Sublime! his shade returns, that left us late!”<br>
      No sooner ceased the sound, that I beheld<br>
      Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,<br>
      Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.
      </p>

      <p>
        When thus my master kind began: “Mark him,<br>
      Who in his right hand bears that <span class="tooltip">falchion<span class="tooltiptext">a broad, slightly curved sword with the cutting edge on the convex side.</span></span> keen,<br>
      The other three preceding, as their lord.<br>
      This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:<br>
      Flaccus the next, in satire’s vein excelling;<br>
      The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.<br>
      Because they all that appellation own,<br>
      With which the voice singly accosted me,<br>
      Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.”
      </p>

      <p>
        So I beheld united the bright school<br>
      Of him the monarch of sublimest song,<br>
      That o’er the others like an eagle soars.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they together short discourse had held,<br>
      They turn’d to me, with salutation kind<br>
      Beckoning me; at the which my master smiled:<br>
      Nor was this all; but greater honour still<br>
      They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;<br>
      And I was sixth amid so learn’d a band.
      </p>

      <p>
        Far as the luminous beacon on we pass’d,<br>
      Speaking of matters, then befitting well<br>
      To speak, now fitter left untold. At foot<br>
      Of a magnificent castle we arrived,<br>
      Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and around<br>
      Defended by a pleasant stream. O’er this<br>
      As o’er dry land we pass’d. Next, through seven gates,<br>
      I with those sages enter’d, and we came<br>
      Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
      </p>

      <p>
        There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around<br>
      Majestically moved, and in their port<br>
      Bore eminent authority: they spake<br>
      Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.
      </p>

      <p>
        We to one side retired, into a place<br>
      Open and bright and lofty, whence each one<br>
      Stood manifest to view. Incontinent,<br>
      There on the green enamel of the plain<br>
      Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight<br>
      I am exalted in my own esteem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Electra there I saw accompanied<br>
      By many, among whom Hector I knew,<br>
      Anchises’ pious son, and with hawk’s eye<br>
      Cæsar all arm’d, and by Camilla there<br>
      Penthesilea. On the other side,<br>
      Old King Latinus seated by his child<br>
      Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld<br>
      Who Tarquin chased, Lucretia, Cato’s wife<br>
      Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;<br>
      And sole apart retired, the Soldan fierce.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then when a little more I raised my brow,<br>
      I spied the master of the <span class="tooltip">sapient<span class="tooltiptext">wise; possessing or expressing great sagacity</span></span> throng,<br>
      Seated amid the philosophic train.<br>
      Him all admire, all pay him reverence due.<br>
      There Socrates and Plato both I mark’d<br>
      Nearest to him in rank, Democritus,<br>
      Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,<br>
      With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,<br>
      And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,<br>
      Zeno, and Dioscorides well read<br>
      In nature’s secret lore. Orpheus I mark’d<br>
      And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,<br>
      Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,<br>
      Galenus, Avicen, and him who made<br>
      That commentary vast, Averroes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;<br>
      For my wide theme so urges, that oft-times<br>
      My words fall short of what bechanced. In two<br>
      The six associates part. Another way<br>
      My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,<br>
      Into a climate ever vex’d with storms:<br>
      And to a part I come, where no light shines.
