      <h2>Act II</h2>

      <h3><em>SEVERUS.  FABIAN</em></h3>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Let Felix bow to Jove and incense pour,— <br>
      I seek a dearer shrine, for I adore<br>
      Nor Jove, nor Mars, nor Fortune—but Pauline.<br>
      This fruit now ripening late my hand would glean:<br>
      You know, my friend, the god who wings my way,—<br>
      You know the only goddess I obey:<br>
      What reck the gods on high our sacrifice and prayer?<br>
      An earthly worship mine, sole refuge from despair!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  Ah! You may see her——<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>        Blesséd be thy tongue!<br>
      O magic word, that turns my grief to song!<br>
      Yet, if she now forget each fair, fond vow?<br>
      She loved me once,—but does she love me now?<br>
      On that sweet face shall I but trouble see—<br>
      Who hope for love undimmed, for ecstasy?<br>
      Great Decius gives her hand, but if her heart<br>
      Be mine no more—than let vain hope depart!<br>
      This mandate binds her father only; she<br>
      Shall give no captive hand—her heart is free:<br>
      No promise wrung, no king’s command be mine to claim,<br>
      Her love the boon I crave; all else an empty name!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  Yes,—you may—see her—see her—this you may—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Thy speech is halting—odious thy delay!<br>
      She loves no more? I grope! O give me light!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  O see her not, for painful were the sight!<br>
      In Rome each matron’s kind! In Rome all maids are fair!<br>
      Let lips meet other lips—seek for caresses there!<br>
      No stately Claudia will refuse—no Julia proud disdain;<br>
      A hero captures every heart, from Antioch to Spain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  To wed a queen—an empress—were only loss and shame;<br>
      One heart for me—Pauline’s! One boast—that dearest name!<br>
      Her love was virgin gold! O ne’er shall baser metal ring<br>
      From mine, who live her name to bless! her peerless praise to sing!<br>
      O, words are naught, till that I see her face,—<br>
      Then doubly naught till I my love embrace.<br>
      In every war my hope was placed in death,<br>
      Her name upon my lips at every breath:<br>
      My rank, my fame, now hers and hers alone,<br>
      What is not hers, hers only—I disown!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  Once more, oh see her not, ’twere for thy peace!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Thy meaning, knave, or let this babble cease!<br>
      Say, was she cold? My love! My only life!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  No—but—my lord——
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Say on!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>        Another’s wife!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  (Reels.)  Help!—No, I will not blench—ah, say you lie!<br>
      If this be true!—ye gods—can I be I?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  No, thou art changed. Where is thy courage fled?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  I know not, Fabian. Lost! Gone! Vanished! Dead!<br>
      I thought my strength was oak—’tis but a reed!<br>
      Pauline is wed, then am I lost indeed!<br>
      Hope hid beyond the cloud, yet still fond hope was there:<br>
      But now all hope is dead, lives only black despair!<br>
      Pauline another’s wife?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>        Yes, Polyeucte is her lord.<br>
      He came, he saw, he conquered thine adored.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Her choice is not unworthy—his a name<br>
      Illustrious, from a line of kings he came—<br>
      Cold comfort for a wound no cure can heal!<br>
      My cause is lost,—foredoomed without appeal!<br>
      Malignant Jove, to drag me back to-day!<br>
      Relentless Fate, to quench hope’s dawning ray!<br>
      Take back your gifts! One boon alone I crave,<br>
      That only boon to none denied—the grave.<br>
      Yet would I see her, breathe one last good-bye,<br>
      Would hear once more that voice before I die!<br>
      My latest breath would still my homage pay,—<br>
      That memory mine, when lost to realms of day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  Yet think, my lord——
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>        Oh, I have thought of all;<br>
      What worser ill can dull despair befall?<br>
      She will not see me?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>        Yes, my lord, but——
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>        Cease!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  ’Twill but enhance the grief I would appease.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  For hopeless ill, good friend, I seek no cure.<br>
      Who welcomes death can life’s short pain endure!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  O lost indeed, if round her fatal light you hover!—<br>
      The lover, losing all, speaks hardly like a lover!<br>
      While passion still is lord—the passion—swept is slave—<br>
      From this last bitterness would I Severus save!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  That word, my friend, unsay; tho’ grief this bosom tear,<br>
      The hand that wounds I kiss—love vanquishes despair;<br>
      Fate only, not Pauline, the foe that I accuse,<br>
      No plighted faith she breaks who did this hand refuse.<br>
      Duty—her father—Fate—these willed, she but obeyed;<br>
      Not hers the woe, the strife that envious Ate made!<br>
      Untimely, Fortune’s shower must drown me, not revive;<br>
      Too lavish and too late her fatal gifts arrive.<br>
      The golden apple falls, the gold is turned to dross:<br>
      When Fate at Fortune mocks, all gain is only loss!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>  Yes, I will go to tell her thou hast drained<br>
      To the last drop the cup that Fate ordained.<br>
      She knows thee hero, but she feared that pain<br>
      Might prove thee also man—by passion slain.<br>
      She feared Despair, who gains the victory<br>
      O’er other men, might e’en thy master be!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Peace! Peace! She comes!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>FABIAN.</em>        To thine own self be true!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Nay! True to her! Shall I her life undo?<br>
      She loves the Armenian!
      </p>

      <h3><em>Enter PAULINE</em></h3>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Yes, that debt I pay,<br>
Hard-wrung, acquitted,—his my love alway!<br>
Who has my hand, he holds—shall hold—my heart!<br>
Truth is my guide,—let sophistry depart!<br>
Had Fate been kind, then had Pauline been thine,<br>
Heart, faith and duty, linked with bliss divine.<br>
In vain had fickle Fortune barred the way,<br>
Want had been wealth with thee, my guide, my stay,<br>
And poverty had fallen from the wings<br>
Of soaring love, who mocks the wealth of kings!<br>
Not mine to choose, for he—my father’s choice—<br>
Must needs be mine; yes, when I heard his voice,<br>
Duty must echo be: if thou couldst cast<br>
Before my feet an emperor’s crown,—a past<br>
By worth and glory lit—beloved, adored—<br>
Yet at my father’s word, ‘Not this thy lord;<br>
Take one despised—nay, loathed—to share thy bed,’—<br>
Him, and not thee, beloved, would I wed.<br>
Duty, obedience, must have been the part<br>
Of me, who own their sway, e’en with a broken heart!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  O happy thou! O easy remedy!<br>
      One poor faint sigh cures love’s infirmity!<br>
      Thy heart thy tool, o’er every passion queen,<br>
      Beyond all change and chance thou sit’st serene!<br>
      In easy flow can pass thy love new-born<br>
      From cold indifference to colder scorn;<br>
      Such resolution is the equal mate<br>
      Of god or monster, love, aversion, hate.<br>
      This fine-spun adamant Ithuriel’s spear<br>
      Could never pierce: for other stuff is here!  [Points to himself.]<br>
      No faint ‘Alas!’ no swift-repented sigh<br>
      Can heal the cureless wound from which I die.<br>
      Sure, reason finds that love his easy prey<br>
      With Lethe aye at hand to point the way;<br>
      With ordered fires like thine, I too could smother<br>
      A heart in leash, find solace in another.<br>
      Too fair, too dear—from whom the Fates me sever!<br>
      Thou hast no heart to give—thou lov’dst me never!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Too plain, Severus, I my torture show,—<br>
      Tho’ flame leap up no more, the embers glow;<br>
      Far other speech and voice, and mien were mine,<br>
      Could I forget that once thou call’dst me thine!<br>
      Tho’ reason rules, yes, gains the mastery—<br>
      No queen benignant, but a tyrant she!<br>
      Oh, if I conquer—if the strife I gain,<br>
      Yet memory for aye is linked with pain!<br>
      I feel the charm that binds me still to thee;<br>
      If duty great, yet great thy worth to me:<br>
      I see thee still the same, who waked the fire<br>
      Which waked in me ineffable desire.<br>
      Begirt by crown of everlasting fame<br>
      Thou art more glorious—yet art still the same.<br>
      I know thy valour’s worth,—well hast thou justified<br>
      That bounding hope of mine, though fruitage was denied,<br>
      Yet this same fate which did our union ban<br>
      Hath made me, fated—wed another man.<br>
      Let Duty still be queen! Yea, let her break<br>
      The heart she pierces, yet can never shake.<br>
      The virtue, once thy pride in days gone by—<br>
      Doth that same worth now merit blasphemy?<br>
      Bewail her bitter fruit—but praised be<br>
      The rights that triumph over thee and me!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Forgive, Pauline, forgive; ah! grief hath made me blind<br>
      To all but grief’s excess, and fortune most unkind.<br>
      Forgive that I mistook—nay, treated as a crime—<br>
      Thy constancy of soul, unequalled and sublime;<br>
      In pity for my life forlorn, my peace denied,<br>
      Ah! show thyself less fair,—one least perfection hide!<br>
      Let some alloy be seen, some saving weakness left,<br>
      Take pity on a heart of thee and Heaven bereft!<br>
      One faintest flaw reveal, to give my soul relief!<br>
      Else, how to bear the love that only mates with grief?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Alas! the rents in armour donned and proved<br>
      Too well my fight proclaim; yes, I have loved;<br>
      The traitor sigh, the tear unbid, attest<br>
      The combat fierce—the warrior sore distrest.<br>
      Say, who can stanch these wounds, that armour mend?<br>
      Thou who hast pierced, thou, thou alone defend!<br>
      Ah, if thou honourest my victory—<br>
      Depart, that thou may’st still defender be!<br>
      So dry the tears that, to my shame, still flow—<br>
      So quench the fire would work my overthrow!<br>
      Yes, go, my only friend, with me combine<br>
      To end my torture, for thy pain is mine!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  This last poor drop of comfort may not be?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  The cup is poisoned both for me and thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  The flower is gone—I cherish but the root!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Untimely blossom bears a fated fruit!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  My grief be mine! Let memory remain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  That grief might hope beget, so leave a stain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Not mine to stain what Heaven hath made so pure!<br>
      For me one offering left: ’tis this: Endure!<br>
      Thy glory shall be mine, my load I bear,<br>
      So, spotless, thou thy peerless crown shalt wear!<br>
      Farewell, my love, farewell; I go to prove my faith,<br>
      To bless, to save thy life, so will I mate with death!<br>
      If prostrate from the blow, there yet remains of life<br>
      Enough to summon death, and end the piteous strife!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  My grief, too deep for voice, shall silent be,<br>
      There, in my chamber, will I pray for thee!<br>
      When thou art gone, great Heaven shall hear my cry;<br>
      Grief’s fruit for thee be hope—death—immortality!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Now with my loss alone let Fate contented be.<br>
      May Heaven shower bliss and peace on Polyeucte and thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Stern Fate obeyed, end, Death, his agony,<br>
      And Jove receive my hero—to the sky!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  Thou wast my heaven!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>        My father I obeyed—
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>SEV.</em>  O victim pure, obedient, undismayed!<br>
      Pauline—too fair—too dear—I can no more!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  So must I say—depart—where I adore!  [Exit SEVERUS.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>STRAT.</em>  Yes, it is hard—most sad—behold my tears!<br>
      But now, at least, there is no cause for fears:<br>
      Thy dream is but a dream—is naught, is vain;<br>
      Severus pardons. Gone that cause for pain!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Oh, if from pity start thy easy tear,<br>
      Add not that other woe—forgotten fear!<br>
      Ah! let me breathe, some respite give from trouble,<br>
      Those fears, half-dead, thou dost revive, redouble!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>STRAT.</em>  What dost thou dread?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>        Heaven—hell—earth—empty air!<br>
      All, all is food for dread to my despair,<br>
      As thou unveil’st, begirt in lurid light,<br>
      The pallid ghost that slew me in the night!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>STRAT.</em>  Severus he by name, yet noble in his heart!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Ah, Polyeucte bathed in blood! Depart! depart!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>STRAT.</em>  For Polyeucte’s welfare did Severus pray!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Yes, yes, his heart is great; be that my stay!<br>
      Yet, tho’ his truth, his faith, well-proved be,<br>
      Most baleful is his presence here to me;<br>
      Yea, tho’ he would all ill for me undo—<br>
      Yet he hath power, he loves—he came to woo.
      </p>

      <h3><em>Enter POLYEUCTE and NEARCHUS</em></h3>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  The source of tears is dry, oh, weep no more,<br>
      Thy grief lay down, thy fearful heart restore!<br>
      Let night’s dark dream with superstition die,<br>
      The dream is past, for here in life am I!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  The day is young, and oh, the day is long,—<br>
      And half the dream is true, and Fate is strong;<br>
      Severus have I seen, who thought him dead!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  I know it! Let no tear for this be shed!<br>
      Secure with thee am I! Tho’ great the knight,<br>
      Thy father will command to do me right;<br>
      The general is a man of honour,—he<br>
      Would ne’er that honour dim by treachery!<br>
      He comes in amity, our friend, our guest;<br>
      To greet his worth and valour now my quest.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  Radiant he came, who left me hopeless, sad,<br>
      But he will come no more,—this grace I had.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  What? Thinkest thou that I can jealous be?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>  An outrage this on him, on thee, on me!<br>
      He came in peace, who all my peace hath marred.<br>
      Who would run safely, every step must guard;<br>
      The wife who danger courts but courts her fall—<br>
      My husband, aid me!—I would tell thee all!<br>
      His worth, his charm, do my weak hearth enflame—<br>
      A traitor here! And he is aye the same!<br>
      If I should gaze, and long—’gainst virtue, honour, sense,<br>
      The citadel I yield, and mine my own defence!<br>
      I know my virtues sure, and fair my fame,<br>
      But struggle is defeat,—and combat shame!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  Oh, true thy shield, thy victory is won,<br>
      He only who has lost thee is undone;<br>
      His noble grief the cost of all my bliss,<br>
      Ah, Cleopatra’s pearl was naught to this!<br>
      The more my faults I see, the more thy truth I learn,<br>
      The more do I admire——
      </p>

      <h3><em>Enter CLEON</em></h3>

      <p>
        <em>CLEON.</em>        My lord, the altars burn<br>
      With holy fire. The victim they prepare;<br>
      On thee alone they wait, our rites to share.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  Go, we do follow thee!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>PAUL.</em>        I cannot go;<br>
      Severus flies my sight; to him I owe<br>
      My absence—not, alas! to him alone!<br>
      Go thou, and oh, remember he is great;<br>
      In his sole hands Severus holds thy fate!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  A foe so great, so noble, is a friend,<br>
      Oh, not from him the lance that Heaven will send!  [Exeunt PAULINE, STRATONICE and CLEON.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Where go’st thou?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        To the temple is the call.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  What! Wouldst thou mingle in their heathen brawl?<br>
      Thou art a Christian, and canst thou forget?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  Canst thou, who fore mine eyes the cross didst set?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Not mine their gods!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        He calls me! I must go!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  I fly their altars!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        I would overthrow!<br>
      Not mine to fly a worship I disown,<br>
      By me Jehovah, King of kings, be known!<br>
      Not mine to tremble as I kiss the rod!<br>
      I conquer by the Cross, I fight for God!<br>
      Thou wouldst abstain! For me another course—<br>
      From Heaven the call, and Heaven will give the force!<br>
      What! Yield to evil! His Cross on my brow!<br>
      His freemen we! O fight, Nearchus, now!<br>
      For us our Lord was scourged, pierced, tortured, slain!<br>
      For us He bled! Say, has He died in vain?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Let timely moderation temper zeal!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  His—His alone am I! His woe my weal!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  In love with death?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        For Him I love I die!<br>
      He died for me! So death is victory!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Thy flesh is weak!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        Yet He will make me bold!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  And if thou waver?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        He will me uphold!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  To tempt the Lord thy God were an offence.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  He is my shield—hence! cursed tempter, hence!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  In time of need the faith must be confessed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  The offering grudged is sacrifice unblessed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Seek thou the death thine own self-will prepares!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  A crown I seek, which every martyr shares!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  A life of duty well that crown can win.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  The purest life on earth is stained with sin.<br>
      Why yield to time and chance what death assures?<br>
      Death but the gate of life that aye endures.<br>
      If I be His—let me be His alone!<br>
      The faith that soars shall full fruition own;<br>
      Who trusts, yet fears and doubts, his faith is dead!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Not death the Christian’s prayer, but daily bread.<br>
      Live to protect the flock, so sore oppressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  Example be their friend, most sure, most blessed!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Thou woo’st thy death!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>        Is this poor life so dear?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Ah, I must own my heart is slave to fear.<br>
      The rack! The cross! I might my Lord disown!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  From Him our help, our strength, from Him alone!<br>
      Who fears denial does at heart deny;<br>
      Who doubts the power of faith makes faith a lie!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Who leans upon a reed shall find distress.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  His staff will guide, support my feebleness.<br>
      Thou wert my staff, to show the Truth, the Way,<br>
      Must I now urge thee to the realms of day?<br>
      Thou fearest death?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>        The Christ once feared to die!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  Yet drained the bitter cup of agony!<br>
      The way that thou hast shown—that way He trod;<br>
      His way be ours to lead man’s soul to God—<br>
      For heathen shrine—to rear His altar fair,—<br>
      The deathless hope alone can kill despair!<br>
      Thou said’st: ‘If Him thou wilt for pattern take,<br>
      Then leave wife, wealth, home, all for His dear sake!’<br>
      Alas, that love of thine, now weak and poor,<br>
      Glows yet within my breast—and shall endure;<br>
      Ah, must the dawn of this my perfect day<br>
      Find thy full light beclouded, dimmed, astray?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  Baptismal waters yet bedew thy brow;<br>
      The grace that once was mine, that grace hast thou.<br>
      No worldly thought has checked the flow, no guilty act has stained;<br>
      Thy wings are strong, while mine are weak; thy love is fresh, unfeigned,—<br>
      To these, thy heights, I cannot soar, held down by sense and sin,<br>
      How can I storm the citadel?—the traitor lurks within!<br>
      Forsake me not, my God! Thy spirit pour!<br>
      Oh, make me true to Him whom I adore!<br>
      With Thee I rise,—the flesh, the world, defy,<br>
      Thou, who hast died for me, for Thee I die!<br>
      Yes, I will go! With heaven-born zeal I burn<br>
      I will be free,—all Satan’s lures I spurn;<br>
      Death, torture, outrage, these will I embrace,<br>
      To nerve my heart and arm, Heaven grant me grace!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>POLY.</em>  On eagle wings of faith and hope ascend!<br>
      I hail my master—recognise my friend;<br>
      The old faith wanes,—we light her funeral pyre,<br>
      Her ashes fall before our holy fire;<br>
      Come, trample under foot the gods that men have wrought;<br>
      The rotten, helpless staff is broke, is gone—is naught.<br>
      Their darkness felt they own, but let them see the light!<br>
      Their gods of stone, of clay, but vampires of the night!<br>
      Their dust shall turn to dust,—shall moulder with the sod,<br>
      Ours for His name to fight:—the issue is with God.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>NEAR.</em>  The cause is just, is true—O coward heart, be still!<br>
      I lived to doubt His word—I die to His Will!
