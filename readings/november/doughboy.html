        <strong>Context (from Wikipedia)</strong>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman" target="_blank">Walt Whitman</a>
           (May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist.
           A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism
           and realism, incorporating both views in his works.
           Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon,
           often called the father of free verse. His work was controversial
           in its time, particularly his poetry collection <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
           which was described as obscene for its overt sensuality. Whitman's influence
           on poetry remains strong. Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe argued:
           "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman,
           without Leaves of Grass ... He has expressed that civilization,
           'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of
           history can do without him." Modernist poet Ezra Pound called
           Whitman "America's poet ... He is America."

      <h2>One’s-Self I Sing</h2>

      <p>
        ONE’S-SELF I sing, a simple separate person, <br>
        Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of physiology from top to toe I sing,<br>
        Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse<br>
        —I say the Form complete is worthier far,<br>
        The Female equally with the Male I sing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,<br>
        Cheerful, for freest action form’d under the laws divine,<br>
        The Modern Man I sing.
      </p>

      <h2>Beat! Beat! Drums!</h2>

      <p>
        BEAT! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!<br>
        Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force,<br>
        Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,<br>
        Into the school where the scholar is studying;<br>
        Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride,<br>
        Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,<br>
        So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles blow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!<br>
        Over the traffic of cities—over the rumble of wheels in the streets;<br>
        Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,<br>
        No bargainers’ bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—would they continue?<br>
        Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?<br>
        Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?<br>
        Then rattle quicker, heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!<br>
        Make no parley—stop for no expostulation,<br>
        Mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer,<br>
        Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,<br>
        Let not the child’s voice be heard, nor the mother’s entreaties,<br>
        Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,<br>
        So strong you thump O terrible drums—so loud you bugles blow.
      </p>

      <h2>Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night</h2>

      <p>
        VIGIL strange I kept on the field one night;<br>
        When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,<br>
        One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget,<br>
        One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground,<br>
        Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,<br>
        Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way,<br>
        Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses (never again on earth responding),<br>
        Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind,<br>
        Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading,<br>
        Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,<br>
        But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed.<br>
        Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands,<br>
        Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade—not a tear, not a word.<br>
        Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,<br>
        As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,<br>
        Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,<br>
        I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,)<br>
        Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d,<br>
        My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form,<br>
        Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet,<br>
        And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,<br>
        Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battlefield dim,<br>
        Vigil for boy of responding kisses (never again on earth responding),<br>
        Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d,<br>
        I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,<br>
        And buried him where he fell.
      </p>

      <h2>Pioneers! O Pioneers!</h2>

      <p>
        COME my tan-faced children,<br>
Follow well in order, get your weapons ready,<br>
Have you your pistols? have you your sharp-edged axes?<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        For we cannot <span class="tooltip">tarry<span class="tooltiptext">to delay or be tardy in acting or doing; to abide or stay in or at a place</span></span> here,<br>
We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of danger,<br>
We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        O you youths, Western youths,<br>
So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and friendship,<br>
Plain I see you Western youths, see you tramping with the foremost,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Have the elder races halted?<br>
Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?<br>
We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        All the past we leave behind,<br>
We <span class="tooltip">debouch<span class="tooltiptext">emerge from a narrow or confined space into a wide, open area.</span></span> upon a newer mightier world, varied world,<br>
Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        We detachments steady throwing,<br>
Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,<br>
Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        We primeval forests felling,<br>
We the rivers stemming, vexing we and piercing deep the mines within,<br>
We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil upheaving,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Colorado men are we,<br>
From the peaks gigantic, from the great sierras and the high plateaus,<br>
From the mine and from the gully, from the hunting trail we come,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        From Nebraska, from Arkansas,<br>
Central inland race are we, from Missouri, with the continental blood intervein’d,<br>
All the hands of comrades clasping, all the Southern, all the Northern,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        O resistless restless race!<br>
O beloved race in all! O my breast aches with tender love for all!<br>
O I mourn and yet exult, I am rapt with love for all,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Raise the mighty mother mistress,<br>
Waving high the delicate mistress, over all the starry mistress (bend your heads all),<br>
Raise the fang’d and warlike mistress, stern, impassive, weapon’d mistress,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        See my children, resolute children,<br>
By those swarms upon our rear we must never yield or falter,<br>
Ages back in ghostly millions frowning there behind us urging,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        On and on the compact ranks,<br>
With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the dead quickly fill’d,<br>
Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never stopping,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        O to die advancing on!<br>
Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour come?<br>
Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the gap is fill’d,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        All the pulses of the world,<br>
Falling in they beat for us, with the Western movement beat,<br>
Holding single or together, steady moving to the front, all for us,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Life’s involv’d and varied pageants,<br>
All the forms and shows, all the workmen at their work,<br>
All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        All the hapless silent lovers,<br>
All the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,<br>
All the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        I too with my soul and body,<br>
We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way,<br>
Through these shores amid the shadows, with the apparitions pressing,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Lo, the darting bowling orb!<br>
Lo, the brother orbs around, all the clustering suns and planets,<br>
All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        These are of us, they are with us,<br>
All for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo wait behind,<br>
We to-day’s procession heading, we the route for travel clearing,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        O you daughters of the West!<br>
O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you wives!<br>
Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Minstrels latent on the prairies!<br>
(Shrouded bards of other lands, you may rest, you have done your work,)<br>
Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp amid us,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Not for delectations sweet,<br>
Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the studious,<br>
Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Do the feasters gluttonous feast?<br>
Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock’d and bolted doors?<br>
Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Has the night descended?<br>
Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged nodding on our way?<br>
Yet a passing hour I yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <p>
        Till with sound of trumpet,<br>
Far, far off the daybreak call—hark! how loud and clear I hear it wind,<br>
Swift! to the head of the army!—swift! spring to your places,<br>
        Pioneers! O pioneers!
      </p>

      <h2>Ethiopia Saluting the Colors</h2>

      <p>
        WHO are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,<br>
        With your woolly-white and turban’d head, and bare bony feet?<br>
        Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?
      </p>

      <p>
        (’Tis while our army lines Carolina’s sands and pines,<br>
        Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com’st to me,<br>
        As under <span class="tooltip">doughty<span class="tooltiptext">brave and persistent.</span></span> Sherman I march toward the sea.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Me master years a hundred since from my parents <span class="tooltip">sunder<span class="tooltiptext">split apart.</span></span>’d,<br>
        A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,<br>
        Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought.
      </p>

      <p>
        No further does she say, but lingering all the day,<br>
        Her high-borne turban’d head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,<br>
        And courtesies to the regiments, the <span class="tooltip">guidons<span class="tooltiptext">a small flag, especially one borne by a military unit as a unit marker</span></span> moving by.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?<br>
        Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?<br>
        Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen?
      </p>

      <h2>The Wound-Dresser</h2>

      <h3>1</h3>

      <p>
        AN old man bending I come among new faces,<br>
        Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,<br>
        Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,<br>
        (Arous’d and angry, I’d thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,<br>
        But soon my fingers fail’d me, my face droop’d and I resign’d myself,<br>
        To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)<br>
        Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,<br>
        Of unsurpass’d heroes (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)<br>
        Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,<br>
        Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?<br>
        What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,<br>
        Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?
      </p>

      <h3>2</h3>

      <p>
        O maidens and young men I love and that love me,<br>
        What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,<br>
        Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover’d with sweat and dust,<br>
        In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush of successful charge,<br>
        Enter the captur’d works—yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,<br>
        Pass and are gone they fade—I dwell not on soldiers’ perils or soldiers’ joys<br>
        (Both I remember well—many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content).
      </p>

      <p>
        But in silence, in dreams’ projections,<br>
        While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,<br>
        So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,<br>
        With hinged knees returning I enter the doors (while for you up there,<br>
        Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart).
      </p>

      <p>
        Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,<br>
        Straight and swift to my wounded I go,<br>
        Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,<br>
        Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground,<br>
        Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof’d hospital,<br>
        To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,<br>
        To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,<br>
        An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,<br>
        Soon to be fill’d with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill’d again.
      </p>

      <p>
        I onward go, I stop,<br>
        With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,<br>
        I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,<br>
        One turns to me his appealing eyes—poor boy! I never knew you,<br>
        Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.
      </p>

      <h3>3</h3>

      <p>
        On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)<br>
        The crush’d head I dress (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away),<br>
        The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I examine,<br>
        Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life struggles hard<br>
        (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!<br>
        In mercy come quickly).
      </p>

      <p>
        From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,<br>
        I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,<br>
        Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv’d neck and side-falling head,<br>
        His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody stump,<br>
        And has not yet look’d on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,<br>
        But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,<br>
        And the yellow-blue countenance see.<br>
        I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,<br>
        Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive,<br>
        While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am faithful, I do not give out,<br>
        The fractur’d thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,<br>
        These and more I dress with impassive hand (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame).
      </p>

      <h3>4</h3>

      <p>
        Thus in silence in dreams’ projections,<br>
        Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,<br>
        The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,<br>
        I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,<br>
        Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,<br>
        (Many a soldier’s loving arms about this neck have cross’d and rested,<br>
        Many a soldier’s kiss dwells on these bearded lips).
      </p>

      <h2>Give Me the Splendid Silent Sun</h2>

      <h3>1</h3>

      <p>
        GIVE me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,<br>
        Give me juicy autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,<br>
        Give me a field where the unmow’d grass grows,<br>
        Give me an arbor, give me the trellis’d grape,<br>
        Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching content,<br>
        Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,<br>
        Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturb’d,<br>
        Give me for marriage a sweet-breath’d woman of whom I should never tire,<br>
        Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the world a rural domestic life,<br>
        Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own ears only,<br>
        Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal sanities!<br>
        These demanding to have them (tired with ceaseless excitement, and rack’d by the war-strife),<br>
        These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,<br>
        While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,<br>
        Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,<br>
        Where you hold me enchain’d a certain time refusing to give me up,<br>
        Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich’d of soul, you give me forever faces;<br>
        (Oh I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,<br>
        I see my own soul trampling down what it ask’d for).
      </p>

      <h3>2</h3>

      <p>
        Keep your splendid silent sun,<br>
        Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,<br>
        Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and orchards,<br>
        Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;<br>
        Give me faces and streets—give me these phantoms incessant and endless along the <span class="tooltip">trottoirs<span class="tooltiptext">footpaths; sidewalks</span></span>!<br>
        Give me interminable eyes—give me women—give me comrades and lovers by the thousand!<br>
        Let me see new ones every day—let me hold new ones by the hand every day!<br>
        Give me such shows—give me the streets of Manhattan!<br>
        Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching—give me the sound of the trumpets and drums!<br>
        (The soldiers in companies or regiments—some starting away, flush’d and reckless,<br>
        Some, their time up, returning with thinn’d ranks, young, yet very old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)<br>
        Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!<br>
        O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!<br>
        The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!<br>
        The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the torchlight procession!<br>
        The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military wagons following;<br>
        People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,<br>
        Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums as now,<br>
        The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets (even the sight of the wounded),<br>
        Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!<br>
        Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.
