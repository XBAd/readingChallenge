A web site for viewing an old anthology of texts (the Harvard Classics 15 minutes per day challenge). I think that the organization of this challenge, one short reading for every day of the year, lends itself well to being turned into a modern app and I am exploring ideas with it.

Eventually I would like to build this app out into a dynamic self-improvement web app for learning vocabulary, discussing ideas, and for annotating these public domain images and texts.
